0,0,"Wonderful time- even with the snow! What a great experience! From the goldfish in the room (which my daughter loved) to the fact that the valet parking staff who put on my chains on for me it was fabulous. The staff was attentive and went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. Oh, and about the parking: the charge is about what you would pay at any garage or lot- and I bet they wouldn't help you out in the snow!",5
1,1,"Lovely hotel, unique decor, friendly front desk staff, central location It's only recently that I've started staying at boutique hotels, so I'm definitely not an expert on the subtleties that these types of establishments provide. But I've already stayed at a few Kimptons and I must say that my experiences are mostly good. Hotel Monaco is no exception. The decor at the Kimpton Hotels is always unique - they have a wonderful way of pulling off colors, textures and patterns so one feels cool and trendy yet comfortable. The lobby and lounge were decorated really nicely in very rich tones. Our room provided a nice view and had this modern, romantic, shabby-chic feel to it, for lack of a better description. All the staff was friendly and helpful without any attitude. Sazerac Restaurant served us delicious breakfast in a really great setting. Seattle is a cute town in and of itself, so the hotel only enhanced our stay. The location was ideal! We walked everywhere and had no need for a taxi. There are lots of restaurants nearby, and it only took a good 10-15 minutes to walk to Pike Place Market. From what I remember, the library is right across the street and is a must see. Gorgeous architecture. Overall, this was a nice hotel and I'd stay here again. I only gave it 4-stars because I recently stayed at a Shangri-La and was so wowed by the experience. But if I hadn't been, the Hotel Monaco would've gotten another star!",4
2,2,"Nice hotel, expensive parking We got a good deal to stay at this hotel for our anniversary. We arrived late in the evening, and we took the advice of previous reviews and did the valet parking. Check in was very quick and easy. We were a little disappointed by the (non-existent) view from the room, but the room itself was clean and a nice size. The bed was comfortable, but I woke up with a stiff neck from the high pillows. It was not as soundproof as we like...we heard music from the next room at night, and in the morning there were loud bangs from doors opening and closing, and we could hear people talking in the hallway. Maybe we just had noisy neighbors. The aveda bath products were nice. We did not get a goldfish for our stay, though that is a nice touch and we would've taken advantage of it if we were staying longer. Location is great, within walking distance of shopping. Overall a nice experience, except for having to pay $40 for parking one night!",4
3,3,"Fabulous hotel Location and service are great. The valet was a doll, the front desk got me to my room quickly and everytime I passed through the lobby, the staff had huge smiles on their faces. I will be staying here often and would recommend to anyone. Valet parking is the only way to go. Starbucks is on the same block for those who need their lattes first thing in the morning!",5
4,4,"Loved the Monaco! Staff was amazing, with a small exception of the valet texting when we needed to hail a cab. He made up for it throughout our stay. Naturally in Kimpton style staff was incredibly friendly down to earth and helpful. Rooms were incredibly comfortable and clean. I've stayed at all 3 Kimptons in Seattle and the Monaco is my favorite thanks to their staff. They always makes me feel welcome and special. I love their wine hour. Ginger snap Cocktails in the restaurant made night. They were so yummy. Bartender Kelly was fantastic. Besides the high parking charge the Monaco gave us yet again a perfect stay.",5
5,5,"Ok, but nothing special for the $$ they charge I am a Diamond Member at Hilton but decided to give this chain a shot when I had my 20th Anniversary in Seattle. Well to start off I booked a suite and paid extra and then found that their website description is not what you get. A suite has more than a bedroom and a bathroom (standard hotel room). When I took my printed reservation down to the front desk and showed them that it said things like two TV, a couch, ect, the desk clerk told me oh, they mixed two suites into the same description on the Kimpton Website - sorry about that how about a free breakfast. You got to be kidding me! Even Embassy Suits has a sitting room, bathroom and bedroom unlike what Kimpton calls a suite. I was here for a 5 day stay and this was how they offer to correct false advertising? I send the Kimpton preferred guest website an email asking about the failure to provide a suite as advertised on their website (my reservation description) (also furnished a hard copy of the reservation printout (from their website) to the front desk manager on duty) and did not get any reply or solution. I also send an email after the trip (guest survey) and once again did not get any follow up via email or mail. So I guess that tell you how concerned they are about guest.The staff ranged from indifferent to not helpful. I asked the front desk if their was any good breakfast spots in the neighborhood hood and was told, no only the hotels. Gee I found one of the best breakfast spots in Seattle 1/2 a block away, how convenient that the hotel does not know they exist. We arrived late the first night (11 pm) and had to go inside and run down the bellman who busy chating on his cell phone to get any help with our bags.Prior to my arrival I had emailed the hotel to inform them that it was my 20th Anniversary as my other half is really picky so I wanted to make sure everything was good to go. I got a nice email back saying they would like to deliver a bottle of champagne and some chocolate covered strawberries to our room upon arrival to celebrate. I also told them we needed foam pillows. So upon arrival no champagne or strawberries, no foam pillows and we had a great room with a view of an alley and high rise building -nice!Now the good - you will not find a better housekeeping staff or a cleaner room than this property. We were very impressed that when we left each morning to go out shopping that they made up the room before we got back (even short trips of 2 hours or less). The beds were comfortable.Not so good - the AC-Heat control has a 4 x 4 inch screen that is bring green and will shine directly in your eyes all night. If you are light sensitive, you will have to tape something over the controls.This is not a 4 start hotel, it a very clean business hotel with super high rates. You can do better at any of the chain hotels in Seattle.",2
6,6,"Nice Rooms but not a 4* experience The Hotel Monaco in Seattle is a good hotel but I wouldn't put it at 4* level.Positives:Large bathroom (Mediterranean Suite)Comfortable bed  pillowsAttentive housekeeping staffNegatives:AC unit malfunctioned throughout the stay Front desk disorganized. Missed 3 separate wakeup calls. Concierge was always busy and hard to get in touch with. Didn't provide much guidance on special requests.TV hard to use and iPod sound dock in suite non functioning.----I decided to book a Mediterranean Suite for my 3 night weekend stay after my 1st choice (where the rest of my party was) filled up. In comparison to the W, I spent about $45 more per night but had a larger (square footage) room with a great soaking tub (with whirlpool jets) and a nice shower.Before my stay, I had the hotel arrange a car service, the price $53 with tip was reasonable and the driver was waiting for me on arrival.Checkin was easy but the downside was that with a room that was picked for its 2 person jacuzi tub, I found no bath accessories (salts, bubble bath etc...) and didn't get any during the stay. The first night (got in around 12/1a) I checked in and had a voucher for a bottle of champagne (nice gesture) and the fish waiting in my room. First impression is that the room was huge but there was so much open space I felt that the room was almost too big. The TV was far away from the bed so it was a chore to change the channel. The iPod dock was also broken which was disappointing.In the morning on my way out I asked for someone at the desk to check the thermostat out (it said 65F but was around 74, which was about 2 degrees too warm) and try to cover its face for me at night (bright blue light kept me up). When I got back to the room that night, no one had done either. That was the 1st drop by the front desk. I called maintainence and someone came to look at the thermostat but he told me to play around with the settings until I was happy (why have a digital box if it won't work!?!??!?!)I asked for a wakeup call at 10am the next morning, that didn't happen. I called later for a 6pm nap wakeup call.... they forgot that. The 10am wakeup call the next morning, yep, it was forgotten.The bathroom facilities were great in this room but I was surprised that a room sold for its whirlpool bath tub wouldn't have had any bath amenities. It was great to relax in the water with the jets going.",3
7,7,"Wonderful experience at the Monaco We are Seattle residents, so it was interesting researching and booking a hotel in our own city. Our daughter's 9th birthday was 09.13.08 and we promised to take her and two girlfriends to see Shrek the Musical at the 5th Avenue Theater, and decided we'd make a fun night out of it by booking a nearby hotel as well.We settled on the Monaco based on its proximity to the theater, price, and Trip Adviser reviews, and couldn't have had a more rewarding experience.The play started at 2:00 PM, so the day before, I called and requested an early check-in of 1:00. I was told there was no guarantee, which is industry standard, so we left our house headed for the Monaco with no real expectation of being able to check in to the room early. To my utter amazement, we arrived and were checked in and on our way up to the room in about 90 seconds. Big points there. While checking in, I asked the front desk staff to send three of the child-sized animal print robes and a few goldfish up to the room while we were at the play as a fun surprise for the girls.When we arrived at the room, it was clean, spacious, and very nicely furnished and decorated. I almost always take pictures for TA reviews, but we had so much on our plates that day, it just didn't happen.After the play, we returned to the robes and goldfish as promised, and the girls were ecstatic. The little touches that the hotel provides really personalize the hotel experience and make it feel so much more homey, as opposed to many of the sterile hotel experiences I've had in the past. We didn't spend long in the room before heading down to Sazerac (the hotel's restaurant) for dinner. In the mean time, my husband sneaked my daughter's birthday cake out of our car and left it with the front desk staff with instructions that we would like to order it from room service so that we could keep it a surprise from our daughter. No problem.Dinner was wonderful, and our wonderful (and patient!) waiter overheard it was a birthday, and surprised the girls with a chocolate lava cake for dessert. They were thrilled.When we finally headed to the room for any length of time that day, we were surprised to find three gift-packs for the girls, courtesy of the hotel, along with a nice card for the birthday girl letting her know that whenever she was ready, they had some cookies and milk for her - she simply needed to call room service. Another wonderful touch.Eventually we ordered our cake from room service and it was delivered along with candles provided by the hotel. The girls loved that. :)I can honestly say that the hotel was dead quiet that night - I actually wondered if our floor was empty. The beds were quite comfortable (although my husband took some issue with the pillows. All things considered, I think we'll give it a pass!) and we slept well. The next morning we headed back downstairs for breakfast and it was quite good. I have a few suggestions for the restaurants Bloody Mary bar - Sazerac, call me! :)Checkout was smooth, and when we left, everyone was incredibly happy with our experience.As a humorous side-note, my daughter and her friends stayed up so late the night of her birthday, that she was exhausted when we got back to our house. At bedtime that night, she burst into tears, lamenting that the best day of her life was over. She also asked if we could go back to the Monaco next year.Thank you so much Hotel Monaco for making our experience so incredibly enjoyable, and for making my daughter feel so special. Well done.",5
8,8,"Great Hotel Fantastic Hotel. Get the goldfish to keep you company. We still miss ours, Phil! Jeff at the concierge was a great help. Loved the crazy room--somehow the stripes work. Will definitely return. Breakfast at the restaurant was outstanding.",5
9,9,Loved It Location is fabulous. Service couldn't have been better.,4
10,10,Clean hotel w/great service! Hotel was in a really good location. The staff was very friendly. Use the valet at the hotel. You'll end up paying just as much to park it in a parking garage that is further away. We didn't eat at the restaurant although it looked great. The room was clean and bigger than we expected for a Hotel Monaco. Short walk to Pike's Market and several restaurants (and coffee shops of course!).,5
11,11,Very Pleasant  Agree with all of the positive reviews for the Monaco. It's located in the heart of downtown Seattle and walking distance to Pike Place and other downtown spots. Rooms were very clean and functional and we loved some of the interesting touches. For example you can request a goldfish as a temporary pet and the faux animal terry robes were very comfortable. The one negative was the parking fee as others have also commented on. I'm not sure if $40/day is the norm in Seattle - it is convenient to have the car valet parked - but something to note. Overall we were very pleased and would consider staying at the Monaco again.,4
12,12,"A Great Hotel We stayed here in March as we were on a Hockey tour. The Hotel is literally opposite the Arena so was a perfect location for us as we had two matches to go to in the four days we were there. Also it is right next to China Town (which is nothing to write home about) and also it is not to far from all the tourist attractions. The cost was a little high at $217 per night but the hotel, location and amenities were worth it to us. The Hotel's restaurant we only ate once in as food was really expensive, but very good. Another nice touch was the wine receptions every evening, which were free receptions for those staying at the hotel. The bathroom needed updating but was perfectly usable and the min bar has to be seen to be believed. All in all I would recommend this hotel.",4
13,13,"A wonderful hotel at a reasonable price I just left the Monaco and would say that this hotel has absolutely everything for the business traveller. Firstly, in all my years of travel, I have never come across such a friendly, welcoming, and inviting staff outside of Asia. That alone makes this hotel stand out from most US hotels. But there is much more to recommend it. The location is good for anyone staying in Seattle for a conference, or with a need to be downtown. The convention center is appx 10 miute walk, but conversely, it is closer to the waterfront and Pikes Place. The room was outstanding. The bed was large and luxurious, Internet (both wired and WIFI) available at no charge to guests and with a very good signal. The desk was adequate size for working and the room itself was not cramped. Paper at your door every morning. Good coffee (but then again, it is Seattle...).The gym left a bit to be desired, but it was adequate and what was there was new, clean and in great working order,and it was available 24 hours. And they did have a reciprocal agreement with a full health club nearby.The hotel has a bit of a funky vibe (complete with faux leopard-skin robes in the closet), but not so much as to turn off even the most conservative business traveller. In summary, I would recommend the hotel to anyone heading into downtown Seattle for any reason.",5
14,14,"AbFab Times at the Hotel Monaco - We Miss You Belle!       Belle and Belle, Too",5
15,15,"Overpriced My husband and I stayed here the night of our wedding. We paid $300 for the suite with the jetted two-person jacuzzi tub. The hotel has a boutique feel - the rooms are decorated with a lot of stripes and reminded me of Alice in Wonderland. The room we had was huge but had a lot of empty space which was a little strange. The jacuzzi tub was huge and could definitely accommodate two people and was like a hot-tub. The only thing was that the hotel did not provide any bubble bath etc. which would seem normal when offering such a large tub. Parking was outrageous - $40 a night. We previously paid $19/night at the Residence Inn. We ended up parking for free overnight at a meter spot. Room service was fast but the selection was limited and the food was okay, not great. Overall, I didn't have any problems with Hotel Monaco - it just didn't seem worth the high price.",3
16,16,"Unique! A great Stay. Had a wonderful time at the Hotel Monaco. The location was excellent, a short stroll to the main downtown shopping area. Pet friendly but the room showed no signs of animal hair, smells, etc. We had a monaco suite and the sleeping area had big striped curtains which could be pulled closed, a nice touch which felt cosy. Had a goldfish named Brandi who we enjoyed. We didn't partake in the free wine or coffee/tea service in the lobby but thought it was a great feature. Great staff all around, very friendly. Free wireless internet throughout the hotel which worked in the suite on our 2 laptops. The decor was a lovely, eclectic mix of pattens in the same color palatte. Animal print bathrobes made us feel like rock stars. It was so nice to be somewhere that didn't look like a sterile chain hotel, this hotel had personality and we had an excellent stay.",5
17,17,"Pleasant stay at the Seattle Monaco Our 2 night weekend getaway at the Seattle Monaco went off without a hitch. From check-in to check-out, the hotel was a pleasurable jumping off point for our activities around town. Comfortable bed, spacious room, nice bathroom.The front desk staff was helpful with suggestions regarding unique places to dine at for both early morning and late night jaunts.",4
18,18,"Good Hotel for Downtown stay I was here for 5 days/4 nights on a business trip and not having been to Seattle before, I didn't know quite what to expect. The hotel overall was a pleasant surprise. It is an older building that has obviously been substantially rennovated. I was in a room on 3rd floor facing the street but heard no traffic noise at all. The room was very well appointed and spacious. The service provided by staff was prompt and friendly, not intrusive or slow at any time. One minor exception was slow delivery of room service coffee one evening, the waiter said there would be no charge. Housekeeping was well done.I would definitely consider for another stay on a future visit.",4
19,19,"Fan of the Hotel Monaco Seattle Just got back from our weekend at the Hotel Monaco Seattle. I did manage to read most of the recent reviews on Tripadvisor. Pros to this hotel: incredibly clean (and I'm a germaphobe so this means clean), hospitable staff, fun design, pet-friendly, and great products (L'Occitane) for guests to use. I truly enjoyed our stay, though I'm not sure the rate/night is enough bang for your buck, even in the Monte Carlo suite. We needed a weekend to relax and wanted a nice room with great room service. We accomplished both at the Hotel Monaco. The room service is impeccable and timely. My only issue besides the room rate is that the valet lost my friend's car and it took them 40 minutes to find it...and they only found it because she went looking for it herself. I read the reviews where some guests had issues with noise, but we did not. Very, very enjoyable and relaxing. Next time, we'll take advantage of some of the spa services.",4
20,20,"Absolutely Gorgeous Hotel Everything about this hotel was perfect. Our room had 2 queen beds and still plenty of space to move. The staff were friendly and the location of the hotel was perfect to where we wanted to go. It is within walking distance to pike place, shopping, restaurants etc. I can't fault this hotel i only wish we had more time there.",5
21,21,"Great stay at the hip Hotel Monaco Seattle Spent the evening of April 22nd, Tuesday. Read all the Trip Advisor reviews before I visited the Hotel Monaco Seattle and was most worried about street noise. Stayed on the the 7th floor facing the busy city street, but heard very faint, almost no vehicle noise which I was relieved. The hotel is located in the center of a big busy vibrant city, and I expect to hear a little normal street life noise, but thankfully there was not a noise problem.Besides the very cool gym, I also enjoyed the complimentary yoga equipment in my room with the video fitness workouts on TV. Loved the fun animal print bathrobes and cool toiletries and the offer of their trademark pet goldfish during my stay.Hotel staff was always friendly, from the housekeepers to Art and Amanda at the concierge  front desks were always smiling and very helpful. The doormen/valets always with a warm welcome as they opened the doors as guests enter the lobby. Evening complimentary wine and beer hour from 5-6pm nightly, and morning coffee in the lobby was a treat. Complimentary Wi-FI in rooms and lobby was another added touch of value. As principle, I get tired of being nickled and dimed by the big hotel chains. I am glad I can honestly recommend the Hotel Monaco.",5
22,22,"A Great Stay It was a great place to stay. The staff gave great suggestions of places to stop while I was in town and were very helpful. The location was very convenient, and I had a great view of the Seattle Library.I really have no complaints, it was a great stay and the price was excellent.",5
23,23,"hotel monaco April 10, 2008, this was the last stay of a college trip and wanted to splurge and relax. Booked because of the reviews read, disappointed because it was much less than i expected. the staff nice, but room small and overlooked the alley and a brick wall. Wish the clerk had told me the doubles overlooked the alley, $300. (includes tax and valet parking, one day) is too much, robes and a flat screen are not enough, nor the offers of a goldfish in a bowl. Will stay at another hotel next time.",3
24,24,"Good location, interesting amenities       View from sitting room into bedroom",4
25,25,"Room not what we were expecting I stayed in a Queen/Queen room with 3 other people. We all agreed that our room looked much nicer, brighter, funkier, warmer online than it did in person. In reality it was dark, and not sure what was going on with the decor- it was very tacky, and not the type of room i felt like hanging out it all day. I felt the bed was comfortable, but my friends felt it was far too soft. The person at the front desk when we first arrived was not very helpful. She was rather snobby and we felt like we were an inconvenience every time we asked her a question.On the plus side, the lobby was very nice. The complimentary happy hour every night between 5-6 was also a great bonus. The bellboy and valet were very friendly and quite helpful when we asked for suggestions on where to eat. And overall the hotel was very clean, which is a must for me. It was an okay stay. But i probably wouldn't stay there again, mostly because the room is not what I expected and though it was decent and clean, I guess it's not what I was looking for.",3
26,26,Great Hotel Another pet friendly hotel. They even have a resident hotel dog. We had a corner room which was large and well appointed. I love the funky chic decor. Comfortable reading chaise and lamp. The windows in our bathroom were huge! The had sliding shutters to block out any viewing! It was Christmas time and they had a beautiful tree in the lobby and gingerbread house made by the staff. It lent itself to the holiday spirit while we enjoyed the complimentary wine and champagne tasting. (Try not to miss it...they even have beer and non-acoholic drinks) I would pick this hotel over Hotel Vintage Park because they do have a small workout room. Some of the equipment didn't work...my only complaint...and nothing to wipe the equipment with either.,4
27,27,"Great Stay What a great stay. We went for a Seahawk game and it was awesome. The only downfall was the view at the building next to us, but we didn't complain. The room is was huge and the staff was helpful. We booked under the hotels website for the Seahawk package. No charge for parking and got a voucher for a taxi. Only problem was that the taxi driver didn't want to accept the voucher and barely spoke English. Funny thing was is that I speak Arabic and called him on it he started making comments about my girlfriend on his cell phone to his buddy. It took him a second to realize what I just said to him and the fact that I could speak his language, His face was priceless. He still was an ass and I told him off. That is to be said about anywhere in a large city. I told the head Doorman of the issue and he called the cab company promply for me to get an answer why they didn't take it. He apologized and offered to pay for the taxi. It was only a few bucks as you are 2 miles from the stadium. If you go for any game, plan on a taxi to get there...but the return you are going to be humpin it back. It was great walk though and we didn't mind. It was right before Christmas was wonderful to see all the lights. You will see the homeless stowed away in some of the building entrances, but they leave you alone for the most part. Police presence is not the greatest in that area as they are down at the stadium. Most activities was within 7 blocks (Pike Street, waterfront, etc) and great coffee shops along the way. The hotel is well mantained and the foyer is awesome. The wine tasting was available in the evening. I will be back and the best part is...you can take your dog. I will be taking my St. Bernard with me next time as he is part of the family. There are two safes in the hotel which one is located at the service desk and the either is in the room. Bathroom was huge and the jetted tub is huge. The funny part was when house keeping walked in on my girlfriend who was getting dressed. We didn't hear her knock and she was doing turn down service. She screamed, my girlfriend screams and I hit the floor laughing. They started talking Spanish at each other and it worked out. All in all....great place and I would recommend it to anyone for the price. Check online for their deals as they are just as good if not better. The besite contains deals and vouchers that other travel websites don't tell you about.",5
28,28,"Very happy and will stay again Came in with my husband, parents and little dog. Rooms were spotless, quiet and well furnished. Staff were fantastic and very helpful and catered even to my little shivering dog.Great location just a few blocks from the big shopping areas and Pike Place Market.",5
29,29,"Elegant but friendly, not stuffy My husband and I stayed here one night with our son and daughter-in-law in the next room. Our room looked out onto Spring Street. The room was not particularly large, but it was fine for our needs. The bathroom was all inclusive. It was all very luxurious except that the bathroom sink was very slow-draining. You have turn-down service, fun colorful bathrobes and the NY Times in the morning. There is a coffee maker but the one in our room had a defect. It said pause  pour but when I lifted the coffee pot it leaked all over which means the filter basket was missing the mechanism. The service was excellent from the valet to the bellman to the front desk people. You do not park your car in their lot, the only choice you have is to use the valet. It is about $30/day charge for the parking lot which is added to your bill and of course you tip the people each time they get your car so we only took the car out once to go to the Space Needle Restaurant. We walked to Pike Place Market and other places in the area. Bring good walking shoes and be prepared for hills. There is an Hour of Indulgence in the lobby from 5 to 6 p.m. but I really feel the word indulgence should be removed and they should just call it Happy Hour. They had one red wine, one white wine, one type of soda and absolutely nothing to eat. No snack to go with the drinks. I asked a woman who was pouring drinks if there was anything like peanuts -- anything at all and she said no, but that sounds like a good idea. I'm sure they have people ask all the time even though she acted like I was the first person who ever inquired. For such a fancy hotel, I was really surprised and wondered why they used the word indulgence. I have stayed at Inn Suites hotels where they have a happy hour with drinks and popcorn so you would think a Kimpton hotel would have some kind of snack.This is a pet-friendly hotel which was so surprising to me. I guess it just seems too elegant for that but I will say it was very clean and I never got the slightest hint of pet odors.There is a restaurant in this hotel, but we did not eat there so I can't comment on that.",4
30,30,"Love the Monaco and Its Staff My husband and I stayed in this hotel on a crazy weekend when we were attending a memorial service for my best friend's husband, and we were celebrating our 12th wedding anniversary. Talk about mixed emotions. We booked a suite and the hotel put us in the Monte Carlos one. We were loaned a beautiful fan-tanned goldfish named Joliet for the weekend, and we visited with the three dogs who worked the front desk, along with their human companions. The room was decorated nicely (though the couch could have used a few pillows). The L'Occitane bath amenities are always a welcome sight. The room was quiet and peaceful. The wireless Internet access was wonderful until the server went down the morning we were leaving so we had some problems printing our boarding passes. The afternoon reception serves oenophile-satisfying wine from Australia and scrumptious cookies. The restaurant was closed for renovation for a part of our stay but when we finally ate there, the food was good and the drinks were even better. One word of caution on the restaurant: if you are a larger person, do not sit at the booths because you won't fit. I'm 5'6 and 125 lbs; my husband is 5'9 and 175. The table was smack-against his stomach; and though I had a couple of inches space, it would be mighty uncomfortable if the patron is any larger or pregnant. Bad design, in my opinion, though the place is decorated in a funky and welcoming way with metal and wood, and handblown glass light fixtures that you'd expect in Seattle, the capital of the US glass art industry. We'd definitely stay here again for any reason.",5
31,31,"Warm  We booked our room on Seattle SuperSaver's site, since our normal Seattle Hotel was booked solid. What a treat---and we may have a new favorite hotel in Seattle.Staff: Fabulous, friendly and Helpful! Room: Spacious, light, roomy, clean and very comfortable.Goldfish: The true delight of my daughter.The 5 pm reception in the Lobby: Warm, inviting--usually I hate those receptions where strangers all get together---but this was nice---light--not pretentious.Location: Perfect for exploring Seattle.We loved it and will definetly return!",5
32,32,"Great Location, Customer Service 101 Needed! A great location to stay at. Hotel Monaco has a great reputation nationwide, but we found this hotel to have some issues. The room was very nice, Kathy the goldfish was a wonderful touch. However, the bathroom looked like an after thought. The shower was extremely small, like a phone booth, and not very clean. Also the front desk clerks provided minimum service. We wanted information on things to do, and since the concerige was unavailable we went to the front desk. We felt like we were intruding on their computer time and they provided minimum information, not even a smile from them. I would recommend management hold a customer service class.",3
33,33,"Cozy stay in a rainy city! My husband and I spent 7 nights at the Monaco in early January, 2008. Business trip for him - my chance to come along for the ride.We booked a Monte Carlo Suite which proved more than comfortable for our longish stay. We were in room 905 which is located on the street side of the building. Street noise was not a problem and the view had to be more interesting than that of rooms on the back of the building which look out at a dank alley and the midsection of a large office building. The suite was very comfortable with plenty of room to spread out. The bathroom was attractive and squeaky clean, but rather small in comparison to the generous proportions of the sitting and sleeping areas. Lots of comfortable seating options, good lighting and plenty of storage for clothing and luggage. Hotel staff were very friendly and efficient. Housekeeping staff did a great job and were more than pleasant. All requests were responded to quickly.The location is quite good. An easy walk to Pike Street Market, Seattle Art Museum (which is top notch) and many shopping and dining options.A very positive experience.",5
34,34,"Soft beds and stocked fridges I have stayed at about 3 of the Moncao branded hotels. The Seattle version is the least ornate out of all I have stayed at, but it still a beautiful hotel. We stayed 2 nights, and I had gotten a suite with a whirlpool tub to relax. Our A/C stopped working and we had to be moved to another room. Beware if you get a room with an alley view as the garbage trucks WILL wake you no matter what floor your are on. The glass was not soundproof as it was touted. Staff was friendly and helpful, the valets were quick to get our vehicle parked at their offsite garage.The beds are definatly made for sleeping. Very soft and plush, and theminifridges and snack cabinets have everything you could want. I have to say that the rooms do feel quite bland compared to their sister-hotels. I felt as if the room should have cost me about 50-60% of whatit did. Overall, I don't think I would stay at this particular hotel again, but I will continue to stay at Monacos. I sure love those goldfish. :)",3
35,35,"Pretty Good In Summary I quite like the Monaco. It has a good, but not completely central position in Seattle. It's a short walk (in a European way) to the centre. The common areas are smallish, but the staff are very friendly and helpful. The Bar is part of a popular restaurant so not intimate but does the job nonetheless. The room was good, the decor a little gaudy but if you like an individual style that will suit. The room was not huge but adequate and had most amenities. All in all a pretty good choice in Seattle",4
36,36,"Excellent staff ! except housekeeping A quality hotel chocked full of staff that make you feel at home. We experienced exceptional service from the front desk staff, the concierge and the door men, however the maid service needs some work. We found that our maid failed to tuck in our sheets at the foot of the bed and on one instance soiled sheets were used. The staff quickley resolved the soiled sheets issue. My guess this relates to one employee and is not a reflection on the rest of the staff.We received excellent advice from the concierge regarding resturants in the area, the happy hour wine tasting was a nice touch and the staff went out of their way to make you feel at home.Great location if you like to be close to good food and shopping, we took in a play at the 5th street theather as well.Pikes Market, Pioneer Square and access to the mono rail is within short walking distance.",4
37,37,"Superb downtown hotel This is a lovely Kimpton property in downtown Seattle. The hotel is four blocks away from Pike Street Market, six blocks from the convention center, and four from most downtown shopping. We felt safe walking around both day and night. We opted for a suite and the extra room was well worth the extra dollars. We had both a living room and a bedroom separated by heavy drapes. This allowed one of us to work early in the morning without disturbing the other. The room was cleverly decorated, the bed was comfortable with high count cotton sheets. Overall, the hotel was quiet with no street noise and very minimal hallway noise.The hotel staff is friendly and helpful. The concierge assisted us with dinner reservations throughout our stay. We would definitely recommend this hotel to couples and business travelers (free high-speed wireless internet in all rooms).",5
38,38,"Great Hotel! My fiancee and I stayed at the Hotel Monaco over the recent Thanksgiving holiday. The hotel is fantastic. The rooms are very comfortable and clean. A fun quirk - they will put a goldfish in your room if you like. The management is very responsive. During our second night, the people in the room next to us were extremely loud. When I told the manager this in the morning, I was immediately given 1/2 off the night's stay and moved to suite at no additional cost. The hotel location is ideal, within walking distance of the fishmarket, shops, bars and restaurants. I highly recommend staying here.",5
39,39,"Got a Goldfish for my Room! I have actually stayed at this hotel twice for a total of about two weeks.I enjoyed the downtown location and great room. However, if I had paid for a hotel myself, I wouldn't have splurged on it. I don't recall the exact rate, but it was around $300 per night. OUCH! The staff were friendly, but have their hand out for tips at every juncture.Valet parking is for the birds. Give me a parking lot and I'll get my own car, especially if I have to come and go more than once per day.Bottom line: If you have disposable income, this hotel is a place where you can feel pampered, but I'll stick to other options.",4
40,40,"Lovely staff, great for business I stayed at the Hotel Monaco Seattle during a conference for work. I otherwise probably would not have been able to stay there for four nights (it isn't cheap), but with work paying for it, I got to splurge a little.When I arrived the first night, it was just in time for their nightly wine happy hour. The woman at the desk let me know there were 10 minutes left and that I might want to swing through there before going to my room to get a couple glasses to take up with me. Yes indeed!The room was lovely; not as big or as posh as pictured, but I also hadn't reserved a suite. The bed was fantastic. Comfy, plush, great bedding. The room had its own temperature controls, so I was able to keep it a little on the cool side, which I prefer.The bathroom was clean and nice. They have L'Occitaine products, which I love, so that was a bonus. They have an ironing board, iron, and hairdryer in each room and many things you can request from the front.But the biggest bonus was the staff. Every single person was friendly, helpful, and genuine. I needed to receive and send a fax ... no problem (and no charge). I ordered room service one day ($28, ouch!), and the waiter was great. The doormen were consistently friendly. The desk staff was exceptional.Makes me wish I could afford to splurge on hotels like this on my own every once in a while!",5
41,41,"Good service, nice room, noisy though. We stayed at the Hotel Monaco for one night on our way to Victoria. Front desk staff was very helpful, valets and bellman also helpful. Stayed in a Monaco Suite, nice size room but we did hear neighbors on one side of us, and we did hear everything!!!! We were there with our beagle and they treated all three of us well. Enjoyed the afternoon wine and meeting other guests. Easy walk to most Seattle sites for us. We knew about the valet only parking ahead of time so were not surprised by it, would be nice to have a good self park option. We would stay there again for the same price.",4
42,42,"Fairly Enjoyable Visit We spent three nights at the Hotel Monaco in Seattle and it was enjoyable but nothing out of the ordinary for a four star hotel. We enjoy staying at Kimptons if we are in a city that has them. They were able to check us in early which was nice. Never once, though, were we asked if we needed help with our bags. We booked the Queen-Queen room and it was a fairly good size. The hotel was very clean and housekeeping did a great job each day. It was inconvenient not having an ice machine on our floor. We had to request a gold fish three times before we got one on the second day. The Fitness Center was very small with limited equipment.Of all the Kimptons we stayed in this one had the nicest lobby. It was very inviting and a great place to relax and read the paper. The evening social hour with complementary wine and beer was very nice. Like in the other Kimptons we have stayed in we always meet interesting people staying at the hotel. Didn't care for the Sazerac restaurant. The food wasn't bad but the service both times we ate there was terrible. Ordered room service once but had to cancel since they were forty minutes late and couldn't give us a delivery time.Don't think we would stay at this hotel again.",4
43,43,"A Little Disappointing After a wonderful Alaskan cruise, I stayed on in Seattle at the Hotel Monaco for 3 nights. The hotel is a lovely property and the location is ideally suited for those visitors who enjoy walking around a city to see more than just the tourist attractions. The decor is quite different and colorful as compared to most other chain hotels, but I liked that very much. One can only stand so much beige, blue and green. Some might consider the decor busy but I found it quite refreshing. The new Seattle Library, which is a spectacular ultra contemporary building, is directly across the street and one block down. The Seattle Art Museum and the Aquarium are within walking distance and are worth the time and effort. The things I found most disappointing about the property were the housekeeping services and the attached restaurant, Sazarec. Housekeeping service was polite but very slow. Also, the ice machines are located on every other floor starting on the fourth floor. I had a suite on the 3rd floor and although it wasn't a hardship, it wasn't convenient either. The food in the restaurant was excellent quality but overpriced and my waiter seemed tired and/or not interested in making my dining experience a memorable one. After all the really wonderful reviews I read about the Monaco, I found my stay there not as pleasant as I had expected. I do like Kimpton properties and I would stay in one again if I were to go back to Seattle, but I probably choose one of the other two properties there.",4
44,44,"Awesome place I had stayed there as a part of the week-long conference program. I would say the location is not the best in terms of access limited by traffic during rush hours, but this is something beyond their control for now. The hotel provided an excellent example of what an ideal value for money was.The staff was excellent, they took care of everything before our arrival. The service was prompt and did everything to make us comfortable. Food was exceptional, too.Of course, the rates might be on a little higher side, and I might not have stayed at this place if I had to pay for myself. But for business travelers and for those who want access to everything within 10 minutes of walk, this is an ideal place to stay.",5
45,45,"Just okay Nice hotel, but nothing really special. The room decor is hideous. Room is very dark and not enough natural light comes through the window, and there are simply too many colors. It was very hard to get comfortable in a room that I felt like was screaming at me. Pink and white candy striped wallpaper should be outlawed. Too many wall hangings and too many disjointed colors. Purple vases didn't match anything in the room and made me feel like I was at Mardi Gras. The pink, yellow, grey and green floral-and-ivy animal scene patterned chair is ugly, ugly, ugly. A simple wood bed would have been a better choice instead of the sky-blue and gold painted headboard I was given.Room, hotel, and restaurant are very clean. Staff is super friendly and very attentive. Flat screen tv is quite nice. Bathroom has marble counters and fixtures and floor look very clean and fresh.Wine bar from 5-6 is nice, but I was in Seattle for work, so it was hard to get to the hotel during this super-short happy hour that literally lasted exactly one hour.Overall, an average experience, but the W and Fairmont hotels across the street will give a nicer room, in the same location, for comparable prices.",3
46,46,"What a Treat! We were in Seattle September 5-9th and had a heck of time finding a hotel. Apparently UW, Boise State, WSU and San Diego Street were in town for football games and brought their entire schools with them! Rates were higher than we had hoped for that weekend (should have come over Labor Day, rates were much cheaper) but the Hotel Monaco was worth it. Be sure to check the event calendar of the city as rates fluctuate dramatically.We booked a Monte Carlo suite as that was the only room available and it was fantastic for a four night stay. The extra sitting area was more like a funky living room than hotel room. There were curtains that partitioned the bed from the living room but I think they were decoration only (would have been cool if they really closed). The room has bold striped wall paper and a very spacious bathroom.What really made the stay was the staff, they were amazing! I was worried at first because they seemed so young but they were most attentive. The property is small enough that they get to know you and are always trying to help you out.Location was good, all hotels that we considerd seemed to be in a 5 block radius so I can't say anyone really has an advantage. We walked everywhere. Highly recommended!",5
47,47,"Very Impressed! My husband and I stayed in the Monaco for 3 nights and had a wonderful time.Seattle is an amazingly clean city and the Hotel Monaco was also spotless. Our room and bathroom were quite small and quite dark but, as we were really only sleeping there, this didnt bother us. The room however, is perfectly equiped and the bed was really comfortable.The lobby of the hotel is quite impressive and the staff were very friendly. We didnt eat at the hotel restaurant but it was very nice and always very busy.The hotel is ideally situated for seeing all of Seattle although, everyone should be aware that Seattle is a very hilly city in parts. The hotel is in a hilly part of the city!! We had a great stay at the Monaco and I would highly recommend it and indeed Seattle.",4
48,48,"Well Situated in Seattle We booked a 2 night stay at the Monaco prior to our Alaska cruise on the Noordam. We thought we had stayed there a few years ago since the photos of the rooms looked right, but turned out we had been at a sister property, the Vintage Park. Not a problem--we have discovered another delightful property owned by Kimpton.The downtown location is convenient to Pike Place Market, the waterfront area, Pioneer Square, and Nordstrom's flagship store. Starbucks is adjacent. The front desk staff was welcoming; the concierge dropped everything to book us a tour; the bell staff was very friendly and most efficient. Rooms are compact, but very well appointed and decorated. Good bed, bedside tables, plenty of space for our cruising luggage, good lighting, flat screen TV, and a very nice clean bathroom with L'occitane toiletries and makeup mirror. We also found magazines, a nice big umbrella,( which we used only briefly-sunny weekend overall) and, my favorite perk, leopard print terry robes! We liked the newspapers--WSJ, NYT and local Seattle-- and the am coffee. If you are lonely, the hotel will provide a goldfish to keep you company. Don't miss the evening reception where complimentary Washington wines and local brews can be sampled while meeting other guests of the hotel (and possibly their pets!) The Hotel Monaco is a very nice downtown hotel with a laidback Seattle personality-we really enjoyed it!",5
49,49,"Wonderful Hotel This is the second time my husband and I have stayed at a Monaco hotel. The first was earlier in the same trip when in Portland, OR. The staff, from the front desk and concierge to the porters and valets, were friendly and helpful from the minute we stepped in the door and throughout our two-night stay. We happily got upgraded to a King room this time around, which gave us some extra space. The parking was a bit exorbitant (I think $29/night as in Portland), but the valet service was impeccable and friendly. It was slightly disappointing that breakfast wasn't included, but the food in the attached Sazerac was quite good. We had two wonderful but different meals while in Seattle. The first night was at the Purple Cafe and Wine Bar, which someone told us was fairly new. We ordered a great mix of tapas (ah, to have those goat cheese and pine nut-stuffed dates again) and desserts. The second night was at Lampreia. If you don't like nouvelle cuisine or lots of attention, you won't like it, but the food itself made up for small and unusual presentations and slightly smothering service.",5
50,50,"A pet-friendly hotel! Stayed at Hotel Monaco Seattle for 2 nts. during the past weekend. We travelled with our son  our 2 dogs (they're both small dogs, a Pom.  a Papillon). Chose this hotel mainly because it's a pet-friendly hotel which didn't charge extra for our dogs,  allowed the dogs to stay in the room unsupervised.We got into problem the first nt. We had dinner at Rover's, which was less than 10 mins.' drive from the Hotel. Dinner took much longer time than expected (fr. 6:15 p.m. to 9:15 p.m.). We rec'd 2 phone calls fr. the hotel complaining too much barking from our dogs. When we returned, we actually saw our neighbour moving out, but we did not hear any barking outside our room.We moved our dogs to the other side of the room farthest away from the door. When we left our room the following day, we left our TV on so that our dogs would not be able to hear noises outside our room so easily. We also delayed the cleaning of our room to mid-afternoon when we went sight-seeing with our dogs. Our plan worked, and we rec'd no more complaints.The hotel staff were friendly in general.The wine-reception was fr. 5 - 6 p.m. Only white  red wine, lemonade  water were served. It wasn't very busy when we went there at 5:15, although all tables were occupied. We didn't bother going again the following day.Amenities were L'Occitane as advertisied, which included shower cap, soap, shampoo, condition  lotion. We asked for toothbrushes (I expected L'Occitane's but they brought Colgate's)  slippers, but housekeeping did not bring toothpaste along. We didn't bother to ask again and decided to buy our own in the Pharmacy near the hotel.The animal-print bath-robe was fun for photo-taking purpose.We joined the hotel's In-Touch Loyalty Program. Housekeeping left voice-message saying the hotel has amenity kit for each of us  asked us to call back. When we called, they brought us one bottle of Evian  a small pack of chocolate, but NOT for each of us though.The hotel has price-matching policy. They will honour any lower rate available from other web-site.In general, an above-average pet-friendly hotel.",4
51,51,"A must see hotel We stayed at The Hotel Monaco after our cruise. The rooms were very generous and decorated uniquely. The hotel, a remodeled Pacific Bell building, had charm and a sturdiness about it. Everytime we walked by the bell men, we felt like we were coming home. Very secure. Great for single travelers! The location is fabulous. Walk to most things, Pike market, even the space needle.Little grocery/drug store a block away. Was on Today show about being Green! Bravo. We had 1 double bed room and one room with bed and couch separated by a curtain. My( snoring) mom slept there,behind the curtain. Great food there and nearby.",5
52,52,"Excellent Stayed in Hotel Monaco this past w/e, found it a delight. The reception staff are friendly and professional, our room was smart with a very comfortable bed. We particularly liked the reception our small dog received, all the staff  guests spoke to him, he loved it. My only mild negative is the distance (uphill) from PPMarket and restaurants on 1st. Overall a great experience.",5
53,53,"Poor value Stayed at the Monaco in Seattle this July. A nice hotel, if it were priced at $100-$150 per night, but it's not. The hotel takes a beating on the 'value' quotient. The whole experience was simply average. Nothing exceptional, and if you're paying $300+, I don't see how you can't be terribly disappointed. My wife and I stayed in their nicest suites for less than $200/night, and felt like we were almost overpaying. The best advice I can give is to shop around. Quality-wise, it's in a league with your average Marriott or a nice Best Western.",2
54,54,Very Nice Hotel and Staff The hotel is in a good location. My room was very comfortable and a nice size. The staff were extremely accommodating. I would definitely stay there again.,5
55,55,"Quirky The decor is like no other, (I wouldn't do my house this way, but that's what made it fun). The goldfish with came with a card that had a story to it and was a nice extra.",4
56,56,"Wanted to stay forever! We arrived just before the cruise season began, so the whole city was less crowded than usual, and so was the hotel. We arrived very late from the airport to the hotel, and they gave us an upgraded room just because it was available....We were travelling with our son and were exhausted, so we really appreciated it. The hotel is very pet friendly, but so clean that you wouldn't know it. They apparently cater to any size pet, which is unusual for such a nice hotel, and if you don't have your own, they offer you your own pet fish! Nice touch, especially for our 8 year old son.The upgraded room has a dividing curtain and it's beautiful. Two flat screen televisions, not that you need them, but they're there.Fun tiger print robes and beds that are ohhh so comfortable.The food is delicious, and the chef gives demonstrations too.I can't remember ever enjoying being in a hotel so much that I didn't want to step outside, but that's exactly how I felt at Hotel Monaco. If you prefer something extraordinary, then try Hotel Monaco....It is NOT your typical luxury hotel.",5
57,57,"Cute Boutique Hotel with Large Rooms I loved this hotel from the second I walked in. The staff was very pleasant and always greeted you with a smile when youwalked in anad out of the hotel. This is a Kimpton Hotel, and stands up to the name which are boutique hotels with personal charm. There is a manager's reception in the eve with wine pouring for everyone in a a nice setting. This one also had someone doing chair massages - what more can you ask! I was in RM 1107 (king) and the images online matched the room and I was pleased to finally find a website that has accurtae pictures of the propert. The room was huge for a boutique hotel and any other for that matter. The mini-bar wasn't outrageously priced and I feel I got a better deal for my money than other places I have stayed in Seattle (see my other Seattle reviews). Next time I am in Seattle - I will stay at this hotel. Perfect",5
58,58,"Nice Value in Seattle Stayed here 4 nights in late May 2007. Looked for a comparable Hilton, Marriott, Westin in the area for the points/miles, but I couldn't find anything so I gave the Monaco a shot. Was pleasantly surprised -- everything was very nice -- room service was quick and tasty, bed was especially comfortable, and unlike some people here I have nothing but positive things to say about the service. Only downside would be the relatively small exercise room (only one treadmill), but heck I was still on east coast time and ran into only one person down there at 5 AM during the four days. Would definitely stay here again.",4
59,59,"Nice hotel in a good location This hotel is a Kimpton, so the design is whimsical and the vibe is fun. The staff is young and casual, and I can see how this can be a problem when the hotel is busy, but during my stay they were friendly and helpful. My group reserved two rooms, and they gave us connecting rooms without a fuss. It was not a busy week.The rooms are a decent size, not huge but pretty average for a city hotel. The beds are nice and the bathrooms are clean and bright, though the pocket doors are less than ideal for a busy bathroom. The room design is bright and cheery, and there's a flat panel TV. The location can get a little noisy, but I was fine on the 5th floor. The location is convenient and walkable to attractions such as the new central library, SAM (the art museum), Benaroya Concert Hall, and Pike Place Market. Parking is steep at $29/night. The evening wine receptions were very popular.",4
60,60,"Even the dog loved it! My husband and I traveled with our dog to Seattle for a wedding over the Memorial Day weekend. We wanted a better than average hotel with a central location to fit in a little sightseeing and it needed to be dog-friendly. The Hotel Monaco on 4th Avenue met all our needs perfectly. From the time we checked in to the time of our departure, the hotel staff answered all our questions, spoiled our dog, and took the time to get to know us. We loved the complimentary wine and beer in the lobby lounge every afternoon (5 - 6 pm) as it gave us a chance to relax, chat with the staff serving, and mingle with some of the other hotel guests. The rooms were decorated with a whimsical feel and the typical white terrycloth robes were anything but, each one a different animal print! The bathroom was a generous size, clean, modern, and the complimentary toiletries were by L'Occitane. The bed was comfy and covered with a duvet. The room was spacious with a chair and light for reading, in addition to a desk for catching up on some writing or for some work on the computer. We would highly recommend the hotel to anyone traveling to Seattle for business or pleasure. Hotel Monaco is part of the Kimpton Hotel group and their website is ---",4
61,61,"A good stay... We checked into Hotel Monaco on Thursday, May 24th. Drove up to valet and was immediately attended to. Check in was fast and easy. The front desk staff was nice and friendly. We were given a room on the 9th floor, I requested a higher room and not to be on the pet floor, days prior.Our room was nice, clean and HOT. The thermostat was at 78 degrees. We adjusted the setting and nothing worked. We called the front desk and they had some one up in 10 minutes to check. He said he fixed it and my party went downstairs to take in the free wine/beer tasting. (very good and they give you a nice size pour on the wine) I went back to the room to see if it was it had cooled down, it had not. I went to the front desk to see what else they can do. They gave me two options, they can send someone else to fix it again or give me a new room. I decided to not take my chances and get a new room. I asked the front desk manager, since it's an inconvenience pack up and move to a different room if there was any form of compensation they could give us. The hotel comp'd our parking ($31.00) I was satisfied with that. Our new room was COOL and had a working fan. This was my first visit to a Kimpton Hotel and overall I was pleased. What I liked:The bedsThe cool bath robesThe TVThe in room shampoo/conditioner/lotionThe Goldfish sent to your roomThe location - smack dab in the middle of downtown shopping/restaurants/pike st. market and pioneer square/stadiums. All within walking distance. What I didn't like:The iron - it kept leaking water and didn't work. The bathroom - no fan",4
62,62,"Just okay Just okay. We stayed here a couple of years ago and had a great experience. This time our room was smaller and right next to the ice machine which was very noisy. Wish there was a coffee pot in the room. Also there were dishes on the hallway floor (not by a room) when we checked in and they were still there when we checked out. Had problems with Valet service, they forgot about us and had to wait 45 min. to get our car! On the plus side, comfortable beds with soft sheets",3
63,63,"Rude front desk staff but decor is nice and good location I have to echo what others said about the hotel. The staff at the front desk is very rude and very snotty - very brusque in dealing with their guests. It also takes a while for your car to get picked up by the valets so if in a rush, allow for some time.In terms of security thought, only floors 10 and 11 require key access. So request a room on that floor. On the plus side, the hotel has a great location in the heart of downtown. I also like the fact that they have a comfortable bed (down comforters) and instead of curtains, they have shutters in the room.Another hint is to request a non-pet room unless you want to stay in a room where other animals have stayed in before.Overall, I would not recommend the hotel unless you get a good rate.",2
64,64,"Wonderful relaxing stay I am trying to go through all the Kimpton Group hotels and this was my first stay at the Monaco in Seattle. Everything was a breeze, from check-in to check-out. The beds were incredibly comfortable and the room (a double queen room) was spacious. I especially liked the l'occitane shampoo and conditioner, it's a nice treat when the toilettries are nicer than what I use on a normal day. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants an upgrade to the other nearby downtown hotels.",4
65,65,"Some corrections/updates to other reviews -Big plus - Internet access with cable, not just wifi, is free in the room. If you have problems connecting (e.g., work VPN), you can press a button on your phone and immediately be connected with an internet specialist that will assist you.-I found a better rate with the hotel after booking with Quikbook, and the hotel updated the rate without me having to go back to Quikbook to cancel.-Goldfish is only available upon request, not automatically waiting for you in your room. So don't forget to ask if you want one.-Concierge and front desk were especially friendly and pleasant, I thought, and not the typical attitude you find with a concierge of a comparable or even fancier hotel, say across the street.-Only downside is the sound-proofing, the hotel was quiet for the most part, but I could hear my neighbor through the wall occasionally.-Another downside is there is no bellhop waiting for you when you arrive. This is the type of hotel where you will drag your own bags into the lobby. I was annoyed that after I had retrieved my bags from storage and dragged them most of the way out to the taxi, then the bellhop offered to help, as if I was going to tip for that last-second, too-late help.",5
66,66,"nice hotel...not so nice staff The hotel is very lovely but the staff is quite rude. Everyone from the bellhop to the desk clerk seemed as if they were going out of their way to make things difficult for me. I waited forever at check in with heavy bags and no help getting throught the double doors or up to my room. The worst part was the desk clerk checking out.... tap tap tap on the computer as my car waited out side to pick me up for almost 20 minutes. When I got home I also noticed the 1,000 dollar hold they put on my credit card that took 5 phonecalls, 2 faxes and 1 week to get resolved. I now stay at The Warwck on 4th and Lenora where the rooms are OK..but al least I have some friendly faces after a tiring day at the airport.",3
67,67,"Enjoyed my stay A friend and I stayed at the Hotel Monaco for 2 nights while we attended a conference nearby. We booked one of the suites, which turned out to be a very spacious room with a king bed and a couch with a pull-out queen size bed. Both were very comfortable. There was a curtain you could close to separate the 2 areas, if you wished, and the room had a total of 2 tvs and 3 phones. The decor is very nice, and a big improvement over the bland decor you find at most chain hotels. The staff were very pleasant. When we asked housekeeping for more shampoo, they gave us handfuls of the bottles. The front desk also was able to give us a late checkout of 2 pm.The restuarant was excellent, and the service there was very good as well.This hotel is in a convenient location for downtown attractions. The view is so-so--just the buildings across the street--but the room did have a nice large window. The room was also extremely quiet, and the turndown service was nice as well.Finally, the hotel was a good value. We paid about $200/night for our suite, which was less than a standard room at the conference hotel.I'd definitely stay at the Monaco again.",5
68,68,"Great Hotel Was there for one night for a quick business trip. Loved the little touches like the goldfish and the leopard print robe. My only complaint was that the Wifi was complimentary, but not the Internet access in the business center. Other than that, it's in a great location across from the library and the service was fabulous.",4

70,70,"Horrible Customer Service  Hotel Stay: February 3rd - 4th, 2007My friend and I picked the Hotel Monaco because of its appealing website and online package which included champagne, late checkout at 3, free valet and a gift from the spa for the weekend. My friend checked into the room a few hours earlier and I came in later. When I pulled up to the valet, the young man just stood there. I asked him if the valet was open and he said it was. I had to pull my bags out, he didn鈥檛 even offer to help. After I got my garment bag and suitcase, I came up to him to give the car key and room number; he says I am not the valet. I had to put everything back into the car, park the car on the side of the street and pull everything out again. I left the key with who ever he was working there and asked him to have the valet park the car when he gets back. I went up to the room, everything seemed fine, the bottle of champagne was there, the oil and lotion gift from the spa. We dressed and went out, when we came back and got into bed, we noticed blood drops on both the pillows and on the sheets where the pillows were. I was so disgusted, this was just unbelievable. We called the desk and they sent somebody up almost 20 minutes later! He swapped our sheets out and left with out even apologizing. Sunday morning we called the front desk to speak to management about the sheets and they became very aggravated and rude with us. Apparently there was no manager or any kind of supervisor over the weekend and we had to wait until Monday morning. The young man we spoke to said that they would cover the food, adding that the person that changed the sheets said that it was fresh blood, in a very rude tone. Our checkout was at 3pm because of the package that we booked. From 12 to 1:30, three staff (maids) tried to walk into the room, and after opening the door apologizing and closing it. Two people called up saying that check out was at 12 and I had to remind them of the package. I finally packed all my things up and went downstairs to check out. Quickly signed the paper and took off. When on the way, I took a closer look at the room bill. Unfortunately they never covered the food, which they had offered and we were charged for the valet. I called the front desk to ask about the charges, the lady that answered snapped back saying that they were aware of the problem we experienced and I should call back on Monday like they told us earlier. I have never in my life been treated like this at any hotel anywhere. I am not sure if this hotel constantly has problems or if we were the lucky ones, but I would never stay there again and never recommend it to anybody I know.",1
71,71,"Kimpton is my new favorite! What a fun hotel! The room was small but funky and very cozy. I requested and had delivered a pet fish, named Pooler. It was a beautiful bowl and fun to have. The daily paper delivered to my door was the NYTimes, a plus being a New Yorker. The honor bar was well stocked and the room service was a little pricey but prompt. On the last night I finally got a chance to partake in the complimentary wine hour which included a fortune telling. Overall this is the most fun I've had in a hotel in a while. I will definitely try to book Kimpton hotels in the future.",5
72,72,"Disappointed I have to say I was anticipating my stay at Hotel Monaco based on the reviews I had seen on TripAdvisor. However, it was definitely a disppointment. The decor of the room and the hotel was as I had envisioned...very nice indeed! The housekeeping staff was very impressive, all were extremely polite, cheery and helpful. However, the front desk  bellmen were below standard in customer service. There were lots of little things that on their own could easily be overlooked, such as the broken make up mirror sagging from it's post in the bathroom, or the jiggly entrance handle to the room (didn't feel too secure when the handle is nearly falling off the door!). My husband had an early morning flight mid-week and we asked for a cab to be called. It was suggested to us that the cab ride would cost double what a private car flat-rate would be, but that wasn't the case at all. I knew the cost of the cab (about $30), and the car would have been $38, but the bell staff insisted that it would be more like $65 for the taxi ride. The cab driver later explained that the bell staff get a kick back for their referrals. I would have preferred as guests in a city and/or hotel, that the hotel staff be looking out for our best interests rather than their own. We were there for New Years, and had planned on dining at the restaurant in the hotel on New Year's Day. We came down dressed for dinner only to be told by the front desk that it was closed due to the holiday. We asked where else we could go nearby, and the response was good luck finding anywhere today. Good luck? Thanks for the help! Another feature I needed for the hotel was to have a business centre that I could work from. They do have one downstairs, but one computer was out of service completely, and the other one was only semi-funcitional. As their internet service is out-sourced, I ended up spending almost $50 of my own money on a system that wouldn't work (no refund), and 2.5 hours of my vacation time trouble-shooting their computer with the internet company's toll free service line! I had asked the front desk several times for assistance but they told me to do it myself! The worst part of the whole experience was that every time I asked the front desk for any assistance, I got a response that included a shrug, as if to say oh well, too bad for you. I found the majority of the staff had an attitude that they just simply did not care if you needed help, and if you dared to intrude on their time, then I got a snotty response. On two occasions, I even caught the front desk girls smirking at each other when they thought I had my back turned and couldn't see them. Talk about frustrating! In all honesty, I couldn't wait to check out. Nice decor, liked my goldfish, the housekeeping staff were great, but the front end of the hotel made me want to dash in and out of the door so I wouldn't have to get in their way, not that I had to be too concerned about anyone taking it upon themselves to greet me anyway, I was pretty much ignored by anyone in the front desk area unless I approached them. Next time, I'll go across the street to the Westin. I saw nothing but smiling faces coming and going from that hotel.",2
73,73,"This is a great place to stay! We thoroughly enjoyed our recent stay at Hotel Monaco. We were attending a concert at nearby Benoroya Hall and found this hotel to be an excellent place to spend the night. Check in was smooth and we loved our room with the striped wall paper and Sunshine, our pet fish. We made reservations at the hotel restuarant and had a delightful meal with an attentive waiter. (Try the catfish, it's delicious!) We'll choose this hotel next time we stay in Seattle.",5
74,74,"You'll enjoy it Have now stayed at the Hotel Monaco twice for a total of 5 nights. Overally, I've been very pleased.Checkin and checkout are easy and I've never had to wait in line. I've stayed in both a suite and the basic king room. The suite is essentially a very large room separated by a curtain. The sitting room has a couch and additional flat screen TV. Unless you're traveling with more than 2 people or want to spend a lot of time in your room, the standard room is more than adequate. Suite bath is pretty much the same as a regular room (they do have suites with jacuzzis that might be more elaborate). Hotel is only 11 floors so don't expect panoramic views.Furnishings are funky but tasteful. Rooms appear to be in good repair. Robes (with animal print) are standard. Large flat screen TVs with many, many channels are standard. Bathroom amenities (Aveda) are replenished daily. Bathrooms are modern with tile floors and granite counters.I've had mixed room service experiences. Twice, it was fast and food (pizza) was excellent. One morning breakfast was late and cold. The soft-boiled eggs were hard, which is good because they didn't provide a spoon. The attached restaurant is okay, but the one time we tried it service was very slow. Have heard that it's good for lunch/dinner but the menu wasn't that appealing to me so didn't try it.The concierge was helpful but was rarely seen before 9 or after 5. However, the front desk personnel were great. Wake up calls came promptly. There is free wireless and wired interet access as well as a computer in the lobby for those who didn't bring their own.There are some additional nice touches. First, they host a wine hour from 5-6 each evening. Wine is decent (and free) and they do refill your glass. It's a nice way to unwind and mingle with colleagues or even strangers. They are also very pet friendly -- actually seem to enjoy pets rather than merely accepting them. For example, this huge dog joined the wine hour and started to wander off into the restaurant. The staff didn't panic -- merely quietly alerted the owner who rectified the situation. The location is good -- walking distance to a lot of things. However, the hotel is on a San-Francisco type hill, so if you walk down to Pike Market, it's a VERY steep walk back up.The one nice thing about this hotel is that it caters to a variety of traveler types. We saw Packers' fans (in town for the NFL game), business people, tourists, etc. A nice mix with nice staff. It is a pleasant change from the traditional loud, impersonal hotels you find in so many large cities. Would definitely recommend it and stay there again.",5
75,75,"Fantastic stay at the Monaco The Seattle Hotel Monaco holds up the high standards of the Kimpton hotel line. Having stayed at Kimpton hotels in several other cities, I can easily say that the Seattle Hotel Monaco is one of the best I have seen. The service is attentive and very prompt. Based on being a member of the Kimpton loyalty program, I was upgraded to a 10th floor room with a great view of 4th street and the excellent public library kitty-corner across from the hotel. I highly recommend a tour of the public library; you will be blown away. My room is quite spacious, with a beautiful flat-screen television, with DVD/CD player. The exercise room is pretty standard Kimpton size, which means adequate but not outstanding: four eliptical cardio machines and two stationary bikes, each with personal viewing screens. The cardio machine screens accept DVD's, which I have not seen elsewhere. As with all Kimpton hotels, and the Hotel Monaco line in particular, the hotel's lobby is stylish, quirky, and inviting. It's easy to imagine spending time relaxing in the comfortable, over-stuffed chairs. The restaurant attached to the hotel, Sazerac, is very good. So far, I have eaten lunch there and look forward to breakfast tomorrow. As always with Kimpton properties, I am able to connect to the free highspeed internet by ethernet in seconds, and am cruising the web and checking email back at the office with no problems. In my opinion, you can't go wrong with any Kimpton hotel, and the Seattle Hotel Monaco is certainly an excellent choice.",5
76,76,"Hotel Manaco is Fabulous We had to make some last minute travel arrangements in Seattle. Since we were travelling with a dog , a Google search of dog friendly hotels in Seattle popped up numerous choices, including this one. Since the location, the room sizes available (2 adults, 2 small kids and a large dog) and their pet friendly policies suited us (and the positive reviews on Tripadvisor), we booked.On arrival, we were greeted by friendly staff all of whom took great interest in making our stay comfortable. The hotel is nicely decorated and the king suite room very comfortable for all of us, especially with the drapery partition between the two rooms. Most notable was the attentiveness to our dog. While many places bill themselves as pet friendly, most are no more than pet tolerant. Not here. Our dog was welcomed by every staff member she came across. Even better was their offer to keep her at the front desk while we went for breakfast. They actually kept right at the desk like a junior front desk clerk rather than sequestering her away in a kennel. An extra service we were not exepecting. Of course, it we not just their treatment of our dog that meant our stay pleasant. It was a nicely personal hotel without its own style and very distinct from the chains. I am now a committed Kimpton hotel user and will stay whenever I can (with dog or without). We didn鈥檛 make it to the wine hour this time, but will be sure to do so on our next visit.",5
77,77,"Wonderful Hotel Hotel Monaco Seattle is part of the Kimpton Hotels group. This family of hotels has an upscale, if somewhat pricey reputation, and Hotel Monaco fits right in with this rep. While the rooms can be a bit expensive, it's worth it in amenities and quality of service. The hotel itself is also pet-friendly, although people who do not enjoy pets shouldn't have a problem as I have only encountered one or two animals in my stays at this hotel. They have a wine get together in the early part of the evenings, which presents a perfect opportunity for kicking the evening off right. My favorite room is the Meditteranian Suite with a two person Jacuzzi, perfect for an intimate night in. Don't forget the champagne and strawberries.",5
78,78,"Awful Being a Kimpton customer expected to find a better place. We had reserved a suite which turned out to be a large room separated with a tacky curtain as a division. The TV control remote didn't work. Wireless internet connection didnt work either.We paid $46 for two coffees and bagel room service breakfast, which arrived 30 minutes late.On our departure date, having to catch an early flight, we had requested room service at 6,00am and after several calls it finally arrived at 6,45am.",1

81,81,"Very nice stay..... Just stayed at the Hotel Monaco in Seattle on 9/12. Very nice quiet corner room (I'm part of Kimpton's Loyalty program, and that is my preferred room type).No view to speak of (looked into an office building), but a very comfy bed, good desk space, window seats, and a huge bathroom. Great perk was the 3 bathrobes hanging in the closet (a long robe made for a LARGE man, and 2 shorter robes more suited for women). Had a great room service experience....food arrived in 20 minutes, and was one of the best chicken sandwiches ever (soaked in lemon juice, and served on a great Ciabatta roll with pesto aioli). Check out was super efficient, and they asked straight away if I needed transportation. When I said I needed a cab to another hotel, they immediately called out to the bellman to have a cab waiting for me, while they completed my check out. A very nice touch.The price of the hotel was my only issue.....everything in Seattle was very expensive for this time period due to a big Microsoft convention and Cruise travelers.All in all, very pleasant stay.",4
82,82,"Good Time in General We stayed at the Hotel Monaco for 2 nights in September and had a good time in general. The room was fun and (very) colorful, the check in was fast and efficient (although we arrived late and the room service was on overnight mode, the desk clerk offered a menu from a nearby restaurant making deliveries if needed - very good idea); we chose to go with the room service menu, and it service was quick and efficient. Cezerac restaurant was great for breakfast and dinner (too bad the look will change in a couple of month). The restaurant staff was absolutely great and very fun. Food quality was impeccable.Flat screen TV was great, Bed was very comfortable. The location was ideal for our tripCons: -Some mold on top of the shower (oh well)-Some scratches and a couple of small holes on the wall-Bell desk agent not as friendly as the Andra Hotel (where we stayed several days prior)-Front desk agent tried very hard to have us use the town car instead of a cab, in the morning of departure...鈥漣ts' $8.00 more because for security reason the cab won't be able to stop at the right place and you鈥檒l have to walk...blah blah blah...don't fall for it, take a cab and $29 later, you'll be at the airport...in the front of your airline... Hope this help",4

84,84,"Less than you might expect Needed a quick, relaxing get-away. I booked a suite here because I really like the Kimpton hotels and knew I could bring my dog and also get in-room spa treatments. I chose the Mediterranean Suite w/ jacuzzi tub (@ $329 a night).I had high expectations and they were dashed pretty quickly. At check-in, no one offered to help with luggage. I struggled up to my third floor suite, which was pretty dark (only one window in the room and that faces a building) and had stained carpet (large reddish stains... possible crime scene?). There was no room service menu and the ethernet cable in the room was broken and didn't work (there is wireless).The fitness center is not acceptable for a hotel in this price range and reputation. It's difficult to get there (only one elevator goes to the lower level and that isn't noted so I had to call for instructions as to how to get to the lower level). Once you find the fitness center, its odd arrangement has to be noted. Cardio equipment faces a mirror wall while the communal television is behind you. If you want to use the small televisions attached to the cardio equipment, you'll have to go back upstairs to the front desk to get headphones. The equipment isn't very impressive and the lone treadmill is out of order. You can find better facilities at a Holiday Inn Express.The in-room spa treatments presented a lot of confusion. Several phone calls were required to confirm treatments and even then, one treatment was cancelled just minutes before its scheduled time. This is a nice service and one of the big benefits Kimpton offers, but the Monaco Seattle isn't handling this service well.Room service staff was great, but food was only so-so. Doesn't compare to other great Kimpton restaurants (the Cypress in Cupertino and the Palomar in San Francisco have excellent restaurants).In-room jacuzzi would have been great, but a ring of grime circled the tub. And once filled with water, a multitude of dirty floaters were in evidence. This was an OK stay. But several new boutique hotels have recently opened in Seattle that offer more in terms of service and attention to detail. The Monaco is going to have to improve if they hope to compete.",3
85,85,"Travel  This is a very nice hotel. However, when I am paying top dollar, I expect top service. Nothing happened that wasn't just life, but I expected a little more supervision....like...my alarm clock went off twice in the middle of the night...I had not set it...the 2nd time I couldn't get it to quiet, so I unplugged it, but then lost my middle of the night timepiece...I would have expected that the cleaning staff might check the alarm clock to make sure it wasn't set to go off from a previous guest's setting. This isn't a horrible thing, but I was paying a lot of money, and expecting a lot of service. Also, my bathtub's stopper was stuck, and I couldn't get it lifted so shower water would drain...Maintenance was relatively prompt, but why put a guest in a less-than-perfect room? Again, paying top dollar demands over-the-top service. There was no tea in the room with the complimentary coffee, and I was directed to order it from room service if I wanted it. $350/night, and no tea? Heavens! Again, just a small breach of service I would tolerate from a lesser hotel. I requested another toothbrush, and was told it was available in my minibar; in lesser hotels, toothbrush provision is complimentary. This was aggravating. The room was large, clean, quiet, safe...and expensive. I was expecting a higher level of service, so I was disappointed. The front desk supervisor did credit my bill $50 for my inconveniences, and I am very appreciative. However, I will likely try another upscale hotel on my next visit.",3
86,86,"Romantic Getaway We celebrated our sixth wedding anniversary with a romantic weekend in Seattle, based at the Hotel Monaco.We had a King Room. The bed was sooooooo comfortable both the perfect firmness mattress and the supersoft bedding. The room was sunny by day (well, the weather helped) and the window treatments kept unwanted light out at night. The flat screen TV was a nice treat, as were pay-per-view movies and a well stocked honor bar.The concierge was able to direct us to an excellent boat tour of the harbor and locks as well as to make dinner reservations. We ate the first night in the hotel restaurant which had excellent food and excellent service up until the last moment when the server lost his cool over a small error in calculating the check. I highly recommend the crab cakes appetizer, which together with an appetizer and Washington State wine made a wonderful meal. Another local restaurant, The Brooklyn, recommended by the concierge also had excellent seafood.The Monaco is an excellent hotel for a romantic or sightseeing trip to Seattle.",5
87,87,Great hotel Enjoyed our 3 night stay at the Hotel Monaco. The room was very nicely decorated. Even though we had a single queen bed the room size was more than adequate for two people. We were able to sit at the table and chairs overlooking the city. The room was very clean and serviced twice a day. Chocolates on the pillows with the turn down service was nice. The location gave you easy acess to many areas. We walked each day. Pike's Market was a great place to buy bouquets of flowers to have in the room. (We bought 2 because we couldn't decide the choices were so plentiful.) We went to the Bank of America just around the corner to its observation level. Cheaper than the Space Needle and a much higher view.We had dinner in the hotel one night. Pricey but good service and food. The complimentary coffee/tea and wine/beer in the lobby were appreciated. Soda would have been nice for the non-drinkers. Many other restaurants within walking distance. We had a car but didn't use it in the city. Thought the $27/day for parking was high. But I guess for a city that's usual. Definitely would recommend the hotel.,5
88,88,"Disappointing Hotel Monoco has very little going for it except location. Reviews in here that mention that hotel staff is lacking in service are right on the mark. In fact, I would hazard to say they go out of their way to stay away from guest. We had 4 in the room including our children and staff kept leaving only 3 sets of towels. Not a big deal but for $320/night I expect better. This hotel has some mangement problems that need to be addressed. Employees are not as friendly as you find at other Kimpton hotels (Argonaught in San Fran was first class and worth the additional dollars). Not once was I addressed by my name or even acknowledged by employees. The restaurant was nothing but ordinary and way overpriced. I don't mind the overpriced part of it if I get special attention and service. You don't at this hotel. The rooms are dull but spacious. The evening wine reception is a nice touch but the way the lobby is arranged makes for a poor place to try and meet other guest. Really not worth the time. At the end of the day I was sorely disappointed and would not go back.",2

90,90,"It's gone downhill The Hotel Monaco Seattle has drastically gone downhill over the course of the past 3 years. I regularly stay there each summer and this last visit left me looking for new lodging options in the Emerald City.I have stayed in both the Monte Carlo Suite and a King Deluxe.PROS:- Rooms are a decent size for a city- The beds are extremely comfortable- The room has functional furniture - including a desk with 2 chairs and a comfy chair to relax in (in standard rooms) and a nice sofa an coffee table (in the Monte Carlo Suites)- Room service is very good - the Continental breakfast is fantastic and service is prompt.- The hotel has added large flat-screen televisions and DVD players in every room.CONS:- Service, service, service. I waited 15+ minutes just to check-in and was not welcomed back as a Kimpton In Touch member.- The front desk reception never greeted me as I came and went (something they always used to do).- They mishandled packages and phone calls routinely (not so great for a business traveler).- My Kimpton In Touch preferences were ignored altogether (room type, pillow type, etc)The personal touches are what make Kimpton hotels special. WIth the lack of service I received at this hotel, I would have much preferred the W across the street.",3
91,91,"Our room looked nothing like the elegant ones advertised for this hotel After staying at the wonderful San Francisco Monaco, our expectations were high when we booked this hotel. Especially since the Monaco Seattle was 100 dollars more than the SF Monaco. We were traveling home to Copenhagen so I considered using Priceline to bid low for a four star hotel. But I was so impressed with the SF Monaco that I wanted specifically to try their Seattle hotel. On the plus side, the staff was lovely and service was always prompt. The lobby was beautiful and the staff allowed us a generous 3pm checkout so we could relax before our overseas flight. The room was quiet and clean and everything worked.But we were surprised to see that the room was decorated hideously. The room we got did not, in any way shape or form resemble the beautifully designed rooms advertised on the hotels Web site. The pillows for the beds were left in the chairs and there was no bedspread. The wall paper was grey and white and very depressing. In SF, I loved the Monaco's whimsical colorful style but there was no color or design in this room. Here, I felt they had really misrepresented their rooms which were dull and boring. For me a nice decor helps make me feel at home and cheers me up and this room didnt do the trick. I actually factor in decor when I book a room and sure, the photos they advertised are usually a bit more polished than the reality but at the Monaco Seattle, it was a pure misreprentation of the decor advertised.At the San Francisco Monaco, there was a lovely spa with a sauna and big hot tub. Here in Seattle, we paid 100 dollars more than SF and there was no spa at all. Why was it so much more?Finally, the room service menu did not include any vegetarian dishes except pizza. It seems like a no brainer to consider vegetarians when you make a room service menu. If you can include dogs, why not cover about the 10 percent of the population that doesnt eat meat. We were very disappointed with the Monaco Seattle. But if you are a carnivore who doesn't care for spas or decor, you might just love the place. The service can't be faulted.",2
92,92,"Less Than Gracious Service We stayed at Hotel Monaco at the suggestion of a friend who usually stays at their sister hotel, Hotel Vintage Park, just around the corner. We were sorry we didn't follow her advice. Although the hotel is nicely appointed the service is less than gracious. As one member of our party said, They don't go out of their way to do anything for you. If the hotel management would work on developing more of a customer service mentality in its staff this could be an above average hotel. As it is now, you're better off going across the street to W, The Fairmont, or Hotel Vintage Park.",2
93,93,"Lovely Hotel The Hotel Monaco is a quant, charming place to stay in Seattle. The lobby is beautiful and serene, with wall murals of Greek dolphins frolicking in the sea. We stayed in a standard king room and it was decorated in a whimsical, unique style. The room was also comfortable and quiet. The hotel is located in a nice central location and within walking distance to a lot of local attractions. The hotel also offers an 鈥渉our of indulgence鈥? which is a beer and wine tasting. It was nicely done and the day we were there they had a fortune teller. It was a lot of fun. The staff was nice and friendly. I will definitely go back and would recommend it.",4

95,95,"Fabulous Stay We stayed in a suite at the Hotel Monaco which was just a few $ more than the quoted room.The valet met us and arranged for a bellman to get our bags and bring them to our room which was on the 9th floor tucked into the corner around from the elevator. It was amazingly quiet.We at at Tulio's at the Hotel Vintage Park. The chicken was scrumptious and the risotto was heaven with a hint of orange.It was roomy and included a 2-person jacuzzi tub in the bathroom in addition to shower stall, marble vanity and AVEDA products. After our roadtrip of 9-1/2 hours, the jacuzzi was welcome relief! We didn't order a goldfish pet but they were in the lobby downstairs, referred to as the living room and also in our elevator lobby.The king-size bed with soft, luxurious linens and comforter lulled me to sleep.I wouldn't miss dinner at The Georgian Room at the Fairmount around the corner. It too was amazing and costs almost the same as Tulio's. Food, service and atmosphere were outstanding!It's about 3 blocks downhill (ie up hill when you return) and 2 blocks over to Pike Place Market. You can walk to the Space Needle but allow 30-45 minutes and buses are free within the downtown area. So if you do hop a bus to the Space Needle, it costs $1.25.",5
96,96,"Cool hotel, great service Hotel location, decor, service and comfort level were all excellent. Great quality was consistent with other Kimpton properties.Typical of Kimpton, they had lots of unique special touches 鈥?giraffe and leopard print bath robes, funky room decor, and even a live goldfish in our room (ours came with a little sign that informed us that his name was Matt). They seemed to have a bit of a goldfish theme going on throughout the hotel, which was kind of cute.The room and bed were very comfortable and it had remarkably soft sheets. Ours was a King Deluxe room and it was bigger than your average hotel room. We had a gloomy view of an office building directly next door, but we didn't pay for a view room, so I can't hold it against them.Sound seemed to travel between the rooms quite easily. We had the misfortune of having a room full of kids next door, but the front desk responded very well by moving the kids to a different part of the hotel, rather than moving us.The only thing that I didn't like about the Hotel Monaco was the $27 per day valet parking charge, which is the highest I can remember paying anywhere. Overall, it's the best boutique hotel that we've stayed at yet in Seattle. We will definitely stay again.",5
97,97,"Great location We stayed for 3 nights in April 06. The location was great, we walked all over the city from here including the sports grounds (approx 20 mins stroll) and the space needle. Breakfast in the restaurant was good although not big portions like some restaurants. The first room we had was on the top floor and there was a loud vibrating noise, they switiched our room to a lower floor no problem. Both rooms were nice, colourful decoration and really comfy beds. Staff were helpful. No safes in the rooms so you have to get a safety deposit box which is free. Turndown service left a small chocolate each.",5
98,98,"Great little hotel Great location, walking distance to everything (except the sports fields and the Space Needle but this is a nicer area of town anyway), across street from Seattle's new library. Unique room decor - funky, colorful, assorted patterns, but fun and very comfortable. Aveda toiletries, spacious bathroom counter with room for all your personal stuff. Friendly staff. Parking expensive at $27/day + tips. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was excellent at $8-$11, nearly 1/2 what the W Hotel's restaurant across the street was charging. Room 420 was not a suite but was quite roomy and had everything you'd need. Fitness room has Precor bikes, a treadmill, stair stepper, and free weights - ask for headphones at the front desk before you go down there if you want to hear the TVs mounted at each station. Tulio, a Seattle favorite restaurant, is one block away --try the sweet potato gnocchi for an appetizer and the risotto - both excellent, as was the grilled lamb. Not cheap though - about $100 for 2 with 1/2 bottle wine. This was my first experience booking through Hotwire so was worried we'd get one of the worst rooms, but it was as nice as any I think, except maybe the suites. We paid $130 (Hotwire 4-star rating). If you don't like the big chain hotels, this is an excellent alternative.",4
99,99,"ExtremelyAccomondating We arrived in Seattle from Florida and had made reservations at a sister hotel Vintage Park. The guest services at Vintage Park had much to be desired. Ex-no help with luggage. So we walked around the corner to the Hotel Monaco and immediately we were treated with a warm welcome and hospitality. We decided to switch hotels, and they had our luggage moved for us, upgraded our room, delivered a fish to keep us company-(I was missing my cats)and it was completely delightful. From the restaurant downstairs, to room service, to concierage guidance,  the very comfortable room. My husband is a nightowl, I'm a morning person....so the room worked perfectly. It had a sitting area with computer access and a seperate bedroom area with a curtain seperating the rooms. Two TV's--so no problem with varied intresets, and quiet time. The hotel is centrally located. All together a gem. Highly recommend.",5
100,100,"Nice and Convenient My husband and I splurged on a suite for our anniversary. The room was huge and as with all the Hotel Monaco's, the bed was very comfortable with a big comforter and lots of pillows. The bathroom was great with a nice sized shower and a separate jacuzzi tub, all stocked with Aveda products (yeah!). The food at the restaurant downstairs was good being in the middle of downtown Seattle was great. It was a bit of a walk to the baseball stadium and the Space Needle, but most other sites and shopping were within walking distance (take a cab to REI).",4

102,102,"Funky... Rooms are of a fairly standard size for a mid range hotel. Furnishings are bright and unusual. Staff are friendly and accommodating but things do sometimes slip - I had to ask twice to get a blown lightbulb fixed, and my laundry was missed on one occasion causing me problems.The Sazerac restaurant has a good reputation locally and the food was fine, although I found the service pretty patronising on occasion.Would I stay here again - yes I probably would but it's nothing special really.",4
103,103,Honeymoon night We stayed at this hotel on our honeymoon night. The mediterrainian suites are excellent and the staff is very friendly and hip. All in all I would recommend this downtown hotel to anyone looking for an upbeat and modern hotel to stay at without the business-like aspect of the W hotels.,5
104,104,"Outstanding service We decided to give Hotel Monaco a try after reading the positive reviews here on TripAdvisor, and having had excellent experiences at Kimpton Hotels in other cities.I've stayed at several downtown Seattle hotels before (including Sheraton, Grand Hyatt, The W) and while I had positive experiences at all of them, I would certainly return to Hotel Monaco before the others. It was truly outstanding in all areas from decor, cleanliness, and especially the service.The reservations and check-in process was flawless. I made a couple specific requests by email prior to our stay, and the staff always returned my emails promptly, ready to assist. We splurged and stayed in the Mediterrean Suite, which was wonderful. There was an emormous jet tub, and the room was spacious, very comfortable, and clean. The free internet access was also a plus. All other Seattle hotels I've been to have a fee.I was blown away by the friendly and competent staff at Hotel Monaco. Everyone from the front desk staff to the concierge to the housekeeping staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.The only downside of our stay was that our hotel room smelled a bit of ciagrette smoke. I had specifically requested a nonsmoking room. When I called the front desk, they assured us that we were on a nonsmoking floor, but that they'd be happy to move us to another room immedietly if we were not happy. Because we so enjoyed our unique suite, we decided to stay rather than move to a smaller room. We were more irritated by the guests who'd stayed before us and smoked in a nonsmoking room than we were with the hotel, which made efforts to remedy the situation.Following our stay, I received a thoughtful and personal email from one of their staff members apologizing for the occurence and guaranteeing that the problem would be discussed with housekeeping in an effort to more thoroughly clean rooms of smoke in the future. I was extremely impressed with this timely response, especially because I'd never made a formal complaint about the room, I had just mentioned it briefly. We were offered a discount on our next stay because of the inconvience, but even without a discount, I would make Hotel Monaco my #1 hotel choice in Seattle.",5
105,105,"Hmmmmm what to say I had really high hopes for the Hotel Monaco when we chose it as our base for a girlfriend's shopping trip to Seattle. But after our stay, I would say that given the competition in Seattle, it was just okay. The hotel has a lot of nice features but little things that detract:The bedding is super soft and luxurious with down comforters and pillows. But the mattress is a rock hard standard hotel bed that kept me awake both nights. The furnishings are nice and the colors and patterns fun but the chair had a rip in it and the wall paper was peeling. We stayed in room 815 and there was a noise like a fog horn that vibrated through the walls off and on through our stay. My guess is it's the water pipes but it was really annoying.On waking the first morning we found that we had two packages of decaf instead of regular coffee. It took them 30 minutes to send up coffee and then they showed up with just one package. This is coffee town USA and you get one little package and 3 tiny dried creamers? There was supposed to be coffee service in the lobby but we never saw any. It must be cleared really early. It's gone by 10AM. The wine reception is from 5-6 and boy you better get there on time because if you walk in at 5:50 like we did you get a look from the manager like you are trying to scope a 2nd glass. That and the food was a plate of goldfish crackers. Classy.Friday night the restaurant and bar were closed by 4pm for a private party. That was where we planned to eat since we'd heard so much about the fun bar. It was another bummer to add to the rest.All over the hotel are posters that say things like the hotel is all about you and your comfort etc. But we felt neither catered to or comfortable. No one on staff ever asked us how we were doing or even said hello. We'll be looking elsewhere for our next visit.",3
106,106,"Monte Carlo Suite Wow -- from the moment you enter the spacious suite and find yourself smiling at the bright colorful draperies and linens, comfortable furnishings and wonderful touches with Aveda products, mint chocolates and leopard print robes -- to the peace and quiet the room and its placement afford -- you know that you have chosen well. What a great place to spend with your honey. What a great, central location to shopping, theater, restaurants and the stadiums. I would do it again in a heartbeat!",5
107,107,"Great Experience Much more interesting than staying at the bigger chains, and I've had good experiences with the Seattle Sheraton. Staff is very friendly, as are most people in Seattle, and rooms have a lot of cool features, including the optional gold fish and bathrobes. I'd definitely stay again.",5
108,108,"Great Hotel, needs a little polish though. I had a business trip for four days and decided to bring my wife and new baby. I decided to stay at the Monaco because their Monte Carlos Suite was spacious, had two entertainment centers, CD player and of course the gold fish. They accommodated me with a larger robe for taller people and provided extra room in the refrigerator so we could store breast milk.Before we arrived I was able to email with a reservationists who answered many questions and provided me local services for baby rental gear and sitter services. I had multiple email transactions and each one was responded in a professional friendly manner.Of course it's hard to do everything perfect. I had trouble using their one-touch phone buttons to connect to either the concierge or room service as the phone would just receive a busy signal without re-routing the call to the front desk, and after I called the front desk directly they offered to have room service call and that never happened.Overall the experience and people were friendly and knowledgeable. I enjoyed first walking into the colorful room and having their own special jazz CD playing (nice touch). If you choose to stay here you won't go wrong!",4
109,109,"Magnificent Hotel Monaco! We spent the first two days of our honeymoon in the honeymoon suite at the Hotel Monaco and couldn't have had a better time. The room was beautiful. We had a fabulous jacuzzi tub in the bathroom. We lived it up, lounging around in our leopard-print robes. The hotel was immaculate. Between 5 and 6 pm both nights, we indulged in the complimentary wine and beer. It's close to everything, and we walked a lot. Best of all, it was only $190 per night (midweek). We absolutely recommend Hotel Monaco Seattle, and would stay there again in a heartbeat.",5
110,110,"a wonderful hotel We spent two nights here and I can't say enough about what an enjoyable experience it was. The room was a small suite, and was extremely nice. The furnishings and amenities were first class. The staff of the hotel couldn't have been any nicer. The location is perfect. I would strongly recommend travelers to Seattle stay at this hotel",5
111,111,"Service Service Service I spent a week with my g-friend over Labor Day for Bumbershoot. The Gray line airporter drops off around the corner from the hotel for about 10 per person, by cab 28 total but make sure they give you the flat rate or Town Car is 38. The location is central downtown across the street from W. It鈥檚 a quick walk to most points of tourist or business interest. Yes the Space Needle is a bit far off but you can take the monorail at the Westlake Center, which is an easy walk away. For the tourist the Underground tour, Public Market, Space Needle and EMP are a must. Leave a bit of room in your luggage because the shopping is great. The neighborhood is very safe and clean. Room: The Mediterranean Suite is quite large, equipped with a two-person Jacuzzi tub and small stand up glass-enclosed shower. The room had no view but we did not care. The room was clean except for a small throw blanket that adorned the foot of the bed, which we took off. It was tastefully decorated and the walls were striped. Trust me you wont feel like you are in a stale hotel. Ask for a gold fish or bring your well-behaved dog for company.Service: All aspects are excellent. Front desk house keeping concierge room service bell desk are all ready to provide you with the warm and professional service. Test them they don鈥檛 flinch.Gym: Open 24 hours with several newer cardio machines and a few dumbbells. The highest weight being 25. They have water towels and a TV. Gold鈥檚 however is within walking distance.Gastronomy: Sazerac is worth a try if not impressive it鈥檚 amusing.This was my third visit to Seattle first to Monaco. While I like the beds at Westin better I prefer Monaco at least until I can afford W. This being my g-friends first visit to both she wants to go back for Bumbershoot next year and stay at Hotel Monaco.",5
112,112,"Hotel Monaco Seattle Cares! I'm a little late in writing my review of this wonderful hotel. I just stayed in the Chicago Monaco which was terrible and I wanted to make sure I made note of how nice Monaco's can be WHEN THE STAFF TRIES.I stayed at the Seattle Monaco in January 2005. The staff went out of their way to provide a wonderful four day experience for me.1. The hotel room was huge, overlooking the new library. Immaculate and seemed soundproof.2. Front desk staff spent 1/2 hour writing down cool nightclubs they thought I would enjoy after the conceirge was gone for the evening.3. I casually mentioned an addiction to Coca-Cola to a member of the hotel staff and when I returned to my room my mini-bar had been emptied and filled with only Coca-Cola :)4. The goldfish was well maintained unlike the dead one floating in the pathetic bowl in the Chicago location.5. The doorman ran four blocks one night to find a cab (I guess they are rare in Seattle?) and then ran back to the hotel beating the cab to make sure he could open the door for me and give the cabbie directions.6. I was visiting my father who lives in Seattle and he came to the hotel one day. He has cancer and wasn't feeling well. The conceirge escorted him down the stairs to the mens room and then hung around until he came out to make sure he was okay to get back to the lobby.The staff at the Seattle Monaco CARES. This hotel should be an example to the Kimpton chain especially the Chicago we-are-too-cool-for-our-customers staff.Well done Seattle Monaco. I can't recommend them enough!",5
113,113,"Loved it! We were recently in Seattle for two days and stayed at the Hotel Monaco. We had a basic room with a kingsize bed, and felt the room was sizeable. Loved the crazy print robes! They were a nice touch. Did not adopt a goldfish for our stay, but had a chance to visit with some in the hallway and lobby. Another nice, quirky touch that makes you remember this place. The bedding was some of the most comfortable that we have had. We also enjoyed the wine hour in the lobby, where we got a chance to meet some other people and share travel stories. Aside from a lackluster breakfast at Sazerac where our waiter was one of the worst we have ever had, we would highly recommend this place to travellers.",5
114,114,"Excellent Stay! What a delightful surprise to stay at the Monaco. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The room was very comfortable, lovely amenities, and friendly staff. Especially enjoyed the hour of indulgence!! Definitely will come back!",5
115,115,"Great location, helpful staff. My two kids and I spent four days at the Hotel Monaco while we walked Seattle. We stayed in a suite, so that my son got the pullout couch while I slept in the king-sized bed with my daughter. The room felt a bit small, but was okay for what we needed. On the negative side, the bath tub plug didn't hold the water in and when I pulled it out, there was hair hanging from it. The cleaning staff saw the plug and just dropped it back in the tub, didn't fix it. Also the one time I made coffee in the room (coffee is served in the lobby), the staff failed to replace the coffee and creamer. Minor glitches, but still room for improvement.The staff was happy to answer all our questions, very helpful.The restaurant Sazerac has fascinating decor, but the food was uninspired. We had one breakfast and one dinner there. The herb vinaigrette salad (with bleu cheese added for a dollar more) was very good. This is our 3rd stay at a Kimpton hotel. They're reliable. I always consider them first when we travel and if we return to Seattle, we'll definitely stay at the Monaco again.",4
116,116,"Good value downtown The Hotel Monaco in Seattle is a great option in this pricey area of town. Rooms at the W across the street were going for close to $400 a night. The Hotel Monaco was very unique, interesting and cozy. The bed/linens were top quality and the Aveda products in the bathroom were a nice touch.You're close to everything downtown and a quick cab ride away from nightlife and restaurants (we loved Lola!).The experience was quirky, luxurious and fun.I would definitely stay here again.",4
117,117,"smashing decor  If you like your hotel room expertly decorated with a touch of cottage-style whimsy and containing every reasonably-expected creature comfort, as well as service delivered with a smile, Seattle's Monaco is the place for you! At $242 per night booked directly from Kimpton's 800 booking number, the hotel is of exceptional quality and cleanliness. Although quiet at night for sleeping, the hotel is nicely located a 10-minute walk from Pike Place Market, as well as adjacent to and across the street from several excellent restaurants and many shops. One can even view the new Koolhaus-designed, architecturally-acclaimed Seattle library from the hotel's entry. The hotel is pet-friendly, conducts a wine tasting every afternoon, and has an outstanding New Orleans-style restaurant, serving small plates and entrees at reasonable prices. The Monaco doesn't ignore business travelers, either, as it has a staffed business center with several desktop computers, copy machine, printer, etc and also will provide, without charge, wrinkle spray and hand steamers for luggage-crumpled suits. There's no charge to check one's e-mail, either! The staff is the most thoughtful I've ever encountered; once the bellman even asked a passerby who stopped to smoke under the awning to move away from the hotel guests, as smoke was blowing in our faces. Also, on another occasion the front desk staff was dog-sitting a guest's dog behind the counter during the guest's absence. My only complaint: the menu outside the hotel restaurant listed grits on two of the breakfast entrees; grits are no longer served, a disappointment to a southern gal like me. Otherwise, an absolutely fantastic hotel with sterling staff!",5
118,118,"Fantastic Service! Stayed here for my girlfriend's birthday over a weekend in June. While the rooms were on the smallish side, they were nicely decorated and the bed was extremely comfortable. I had called prior to our trip to have the concierge make dinner reservations for us. I had casually mentioned to him that we were making the trip to celebrate her birthday and upon arrival in our room we found a compimentary birthday cake and bottle of champage. During our stay, the staff was extremely friendly, polite, and helpful. We found the concierge staff to be especially helpful. We are looking forward to another trip to Seattle and stay at the Monaco!",5
119,119,Worthy of T+L World's Best List We just returned from four nights at the Hotel Monaco Seattle and absolutely loved it. The room was very large (Mediterranean Suite) with a spacious bathroom that included a separate shower and very deep jacuzzi tub (big enough for two). The towels are fluffy and Aveda bath products are restocked daily. The location of the hotel is fabulous with Pike Place Market being a short walk in one direction and Pioneer Square being a 10 or 15 minute walk in the other direction. We had two meals at the restaurant associated with the hotel and were very pleased with both. One rainy night we decided to stay in and order room service dinner. Our meal was delivered quickly by a very friendly staff person. Everyone we spoke with at the hotel was helpful and very friendly. Ask the concierge to arrange a town car for transport back to Sea-Tac - much better than a cab and about the same price!,5
120,120,"fabulous for dog-lovers we just stayed at the monaco while seeing red sox games. front desk staff was super, and our room on the 11th floor was spacious and comfortable, with an excellent bed. if you travel with a dog, this place is great: when you go out, you leave your dog with the front desk staff, and they take care of fido! they obviously love dogs (the concierge has an adorable wheaton terrier named truman) and the dogs obviously love it!",5
121,121,"Fantastic hotel experience There's nothing I would change about our experience at the Hotel Monaco. We stayed for 5 nights and the level of professionalism was excellent. The room was large (by English standards) and the jucuzzi was enjoyable. We didn't think the room was garish - or the hotel for that fact. I had expected something very loud (especially after reading some of the reviews) but I was pleasently surprised. The staff and customer service were excellent. Upon arrival the hotel were hosting a fashion show and the atmosphere was fantastic. If we weren't so tried after our flight we would have stayed to watch. The hotel safes are free and were located in reception. The wine 'hour' was great and although we were only back in time for one of the sessions it was lovely to kick back and relax. We did ask for a goldfish upon arrival although one didn't quite make it to our room. We could have followed this up by asking again, but we were just curious and, as we don't have children, decided not to pursue it. I have to agree with someone else review that the goldfish toys were a little tacky.As for the location, it was excellent, although I wouldn't recommend it for those with mobility problems unless you plan to go everywhere by car. Downtown was approximately 10 minutes walk in one direction, Pioneer Square about 15 minutes walk in the opposite direction. The monorail is located downtown in the shopping centre/mall and is approx 5 minutes to the Space Centre (Space Needle, EMP etc). There are a couple of hotel restaurants located near to Monaco although we didn't try these. There are a couple of cafe type restaurants located a couple of minutes from the hotel for breakfast and lunch and a supermarket that stocked pretty much everything. One thing I will say is that there were 3 or 4 homeless 'panhandlers' located a couple of minutes from the hotel. Although they didn't bother us we did see one physically grab someone walking by (although they were shrugged off and he didn't procede any further) and another tried to grab someone's bag. We were told (whilst in Vancouver) that the downtown area is notorious for people snatching women's bags. It's something that happens in all cities, so you just have to be as aware as you would be at home. We were able to walk from the Space Centre to Queen Anne's District although this was a bit of a hike, but one we throughly enjoyed. If you get to Queen Anne's try and get up to Millionaire's row around 6th or 7th Avenue (well it was 6 or 7 blocks walk) as the view is wonderful. We paid for a city pass which was only worthwhile if you manage to see most of the sights. We wouldn't recommend the EMP (Experience Music Project) which was quite expensive for what you got. We did take the 1 hour harbour cruise which we thought was worthwhile as we picked up a bit of history on Seattle. The restaurant next door to the hotel was convenient and although it's not in the hotel there is a connecting door so it feels as if it's part of it. We both agreed we had pretty much exhausted Seattle in the time we were there - but we were on foot since we didn't want the expense of hiring a car and dealing with traffic on the 'wrong' side of the road.I hope this review gives you some idea of the hotel and Seattle itself. If you decide to stay at Hotel Monaco, we hope you enjoy it as much as we did.",5
122,122,"Hotel Monaco - Great Location and Service The Hotel Monaco is centrally located and provides excellent service. I recently stayed there from 4/23-5/1. When we originally checked in, there was a slight problem as we were informed that though we booked two queen beds via expedia, they had us in a room with one king bed. Fortunately, a fellow guest was also checking in at the same time and we swapped rooms. For future reference - if booking via expedia, I would recommend double checking with the hotel to ensure that you receive the correct room. The staff also stated that sometimes it is better to book through the hotel directly as they will match online rates. Additionally, the concierge (Marco) was very helpful. On Sat night, we called Salty's to make reservations for brunch the next day and were informed that there were no seats available. The following day, the concierge called the restaurant a few hours before we wanted to dine and was able to book a table for 5 that also had a great window view. The hotel is only a few blocks away from the Pike Place Market , the Seattle Art Museum, and the shopping district, and within walking distance of the Space Needle, Experience Music Project and other attractions. Ammenities and services provided by the hotel include: a pet goldfish, wine tasting and also a yoga mat that you can use in your room. If in Seattle, I would also recommend taking a helicopter tour of Mt. St. Helens via the Hoffstadt Visitor's Center.",5
123,123,"A fabulous gem I have stayed at other Kimpton properties in Chicago and San Francisco. The Hotel Monaco is the best yet. The staff was friendly, attentive and helpful without being in the way. The hotel was clean and well maintained in both the rooms and the public areas. The rooms are comfortable and the beds and linens very cozy. Room service was prompt and the food was excellent. I have stayed at more expensive hotels in the past - Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons - and this property was as good if not better than some of those. If there is one drawback, it is the size of the fitenss room, however, I used the hilly terrain of Seattle as my workout room.",5
124,124,"More than OK Last year I stayed at the Fairmont Olympic in Seattle; the Monaco gets close. Whereas the Fairmont is all about grandeur, the Monaco is smaller, cosier and more personal. Staff is very friendly. My room on the 10th floor was spacious, quiet, and well-equipped. Large bathroom with Aveda products, king size bed with lovely pillows...and the possibility to get a *real* goldfish in your room during your stay. The hotel is well located for shopping and entertainment, the bar/lobby is lively and there is every week a free wine tasting. No doubt, a good choice for your stay in Seattle, whether on business or for leisure travel.",4
125,125,worst nights stay one of the worst nights ever at first our room was across from elevator and we did not want to listen to the ding when the door opens. we asked for another room we were given a 3rd floor corner on the street side. view of market and closed down theater. was woken by drunk and disorderly people on the street. bed was so uncomfortable must of been the original mattress from opening day. If was the worst night I think I have spent in a hotel. Staff did not care to listen to our complaint and charged us full price anyway. We traveled with another couple and they were on the 5th floor two floors above us and had the same problems.,1
126,126,"Ugh Well where do I start? HORRIBLE!. Okay the location was good and the restaurant was superb. Ralphs market was across the street and great as well as Dahlias restaurant. As for the hotel itself. We arrived there an hour early and were punished. Desk Clerk had something to say about our New Yawk accent. We were then punished by being given a handicap access room that had no bathtub. The room was drafty and it faced the parking lot and construction site which was noisy. The bed and the bed linens looked and felt like they were from the original days of George Washington. Shabby and nasty. The tv was antiquated, the stations limited. No fridge, small towels and never enough of them. Parking was almost 30 dollars a night and internet was exorbitant as well. The pool was nothing to write home about and the fitness room was .,. limited as well. all in all i would say that if it were the last hotel in Seattle I would sooner camp out.",1
127,127,"Disappointing Amenities Part of the reason we selected the hotel was because it advertised having a pool and hot-tub. The Pool ended up being so dirty that the sides, above the water were black with grime and people had taken to scratching profanities into it. Otherwise the rest of the pool had dark dirt stains covering the bottom and sides.The hot-tub was luke warm at best and just like the pool it was filthy. We informed the desk about both the pool and the hot-tub and they stated they were cleaned regularly and were operating as they should. These statements indicated to us they did not care about what we thought once they had our money.A further complaint was the difficulty in finding information related to their parking accommodations which turned out to cost an additional $27/day.The rooms themselves were adequate although the marble in the bathrooms could have used a thorough cleaning as they had dirt and rust stains.The best part about the hotel was the location as it was in walking distance of the Space Needle, The Public Market and for us Qwest Field.This hotel is good if you are just looking to catch some sleep but you do not worry too much about quality. If you want to soak in the hot-tub or swim in the pool at the end of a long day look for other accommodations.",2
128,128,great hotel and location a great hotel with a fantastic location.stayed on the 9th floor with a space needle view.clean spacious rooms with a superb view.staff were very friendly and chatty.breakfast in the restaurant was very good as was happy hour from 4pm to 7pm in the bar.10 mins walk to space needle and 5 mins walk to macys and the shops...i cannot fault the hotel over my 4 night stay......excellent..............,5
129,129,"Dirty, Shabby and they did a bait  This is a bait  switch type of place.We stayed there before our cruise to Alaska, and I called from Pennsylvania to verify non-smoking.The staff would not listen when I said I refused to stay in his horrible smelly and dirty room. The lobby was also dirty, and they cannot accommodate a group of people before a cruise.About 4 hours later, after they sent a man with a can of spray to remove the smoke???? really a can of spray???? YES!, and I refused to stay there, they found a room with 8 spotlights in the ceiling, no towel bars on the 2nd floor that was non-smoking.I wonder what this room is used for during other times, because no other hotel room has 8 spotlights pointing to the bed????Perhaps the police needs to know about this place that has 8 spotlights pointing to the bed???!!!We had to move our things ourselves after fighting with them for hours. And the consierge gave out bad advice about what time to leave for the ship. They said they have a smoking floor for over 20 years, and there is no way they can remove the smell of smoke from a room.I said I called long distance from Pennsylvania a week before the stay, and they said no problem.Don't waste your time or money by staying at the Warwickand they do nothing to help you. if you want a great place try the Doubletree Suites at Seattle, WA SEATAC near the airport for a large room with great accommodations and a great staff and they have people in the lobby to print your airline boarding passes with complete gracious, efficient staff for everything!",1
130,130,"Be sure to get a high floor Got a room on the 3rd floor... checked in around 2100h, so options were limited. Room balcony was across from Cinerama and crowd was noisy (Indiana Jones' premiere).Very cramped lobby but free WiFi around ground floor, but not in hotel premises.",3
131,131,"Decent accomodations, no stand-out service       Seattle Warwick",3
132,132,"Good hotel. Luxury? Not so much. We chose the hotel due to the excellent location in Seattle. I booked by contacting the property directly and had a wonderful first impression of the service. I also called back to verify that I advised of a late check-in and was once gain spoke with a courteous property representative. The hotel recommended a terrific sedan service direct to the hotel (complete with mini tour of the city). Check-in was effortless and the room request was honored as booked. We requested an upper floor (needle facing) and frankly am glad we had the booking. At 0600hrs there were a couple of folks in a theatre entranceway across the street from the hotel whose voices were amplified in the entrance, we could hear them on the 15th floor. Gilcrest and Soames toilettries were a nice touch and other room features are frankly forgettable (for a property considered to be 'luxury.)The view was nice, breakfast was great, fast and friendly in the dining room and the complimentary business center was a G*dsend (since I forgot my Seattle maps). One may come across websurfers monopolizing the computers, so get there early. For those familiar with Ralphs grocery in California, sadly the one across from the property is not the same. We reserved our walkabout for the next day in daylight, as the area has some sketchy elements if one is not familiar with Seattle. We'd stay there again.",4
133,133,"Nice stay Stayed here the night before our cruise.We choose this hotel by the price and walking distance to the pier.Nice room with great view of Space Needle, clean and comfortable, very nice toiletries available to guests.All we did was sleep, shower and leave so can not review the other options the hotel has to offer except the lobby looked bright and inviting and the doorman was very helpful to us.I do feel it was too expensive but then any hotel we looked for in the pier area was too expensive.Easy walk to the pier and many places to eat along the way.",3
134,134,"Great location - they need to internally upgrade to take advantage North end of downtown Seattle, great restaurants nearby, good prices. The rooms need to be updated, literally thought I was sleeping on a 1970's bed with old pillows and sheets. Net result is a bad nights sleep. I would stay their again for the location but that is it. Staff is very friendly also.",2
135,135,"Nothing Special but great location... As a travel agent myself, I booked my group at this hotel for both the a pre-cruise stay and post-cruise stay. My room faced the Space Needle on both stays making for a great view. I have to say that this had to be the loudest, noisiest hotel room I have ever stayed in anywhere. My 1st night there, Sept. 12th, the city was doing road work on one of the cross streets until 1pm, then at 3pm drunk neighbors were yelling off their balcony to the street people partying in the parking lot below. Doesn't make for a good nights rest after flying for 4 hours and checking in at 10:30pm. If you are a light sleeper (or if you have any problems with night noise), request a back room that faces the back streets and not the space needle. The lobby is so very small so when you have a lot of rooms checking in/out at the same time then there is no room for people to even move at the counter with luggage. I find that this hotel is sold-out often so getting early check-in is hard. I found the rooms to be nothing but standard. I wouldn't consider them anything near 4-star, nor the hotel for that matter. I have stayed in numerous hotels around the world from 2-star to 5-star and this one I ranked as just a room to stopover at prior to the cruise. The room was clean, bathroom was clean but nothing to write home about. The one major thing that the Warwick has going for it is it's location! You can walk to Pike Place Market as well as many places to eat like MaMa's for Mexican.  The bellman - Joe, at the Warwick was the best employee that we encountered there. He helped us with informing us with which bus numbers to take to go down to Pioneer Sqaure (there's a free city bus that stops right outside the Warwick that goes to Pioneer Sqaure). He also set up our car service back to the airport for us without even being asked to. Just left us a voice mail in our room saying what time they would pick us up in the morning. It's cheaper to take the car service than a taxi so the hotel can arrange that for you. I did eat 1 meal at the Warwick and that was breakfast, it was fine. $40 for 3 people and all I ordered was the blueberry pancakes. If time had permitted I would have walked to Pike Place Market and ate down there. Bottled water in the room is $4 so run across the street to the grocery store and buy it there, it will be cheaper for you. There is no safe in the rooms and they charge I think $11 per day for internet service. Parking is $26 per day at the hotel unless you get in on one of trhe Weekend Specials. If you have a group going to Seattle, we used Shuttle Express and set up a private city tour for 3 1/2 hours and they took us all the places we wanted to go. It was great and they picked us up right at the hotel. Got a really good rate and by having the private tour we didn't have outsiders with us so it made it a lot more fun.",2
136,136,We haven't even stayed there yet and have been treated like dirt! I just booked our room on hotwire and was disappointed as soon as I saw the hotel. It looks old and not well kept. I called to see what type of room we would be receiving and the operator treated me like I was a homeless person begging for a room instead of a paying guest. I am absolutely sick that we are now stuck at this hotel.,1

138,138,"Didn't sleep a wink! I am a business and a for pleasure traveller, have stayed in many hotels around the world from Hostels to 5 Stars, so this will be a very honest review. I am in my hotel room right now at the Warwick writing this review with red eyes because of the lack of sleep I got. Despite the fact that I reserved the room on the Warwick Website about 2 weeks prior to my stay and requested a High Floor Room, Away from the Elevator....I received the complete opposite. Third floor room, right in front of the Elevator. It was like they didn't even read my request. Upon arrival the Receptionist did look for alternate rooms for me, but said there was absolutley nothing...which is funny because I hopped in the elevator with someone who just checked in about 4 hours after me and they pushed the 10th floor. Don't know how they didn't have any higher rooms... Needless to say the noise in the city is horrible...buses going by every 5 minutes, the elevator doors shutting, opening and beeping constantly...Other things that bothered me: Shower has no pressure, it was like being spit on. Nickle and Diming of services such as parking for $27 a day! and $11 a day for Internet. Beds are old and bedding is old and uncomfortable. Sheraton standards are much better, if I were you I'd spend the extra $50 per night and stay there! Service was just ok. Didn't feel special, but didn't feel like they were rude either. The only good thing: location. Pretty close to everything. Otherwise, like I said...stay at the Sheraton or Marriott.",2
139,139,"Just a Tourist We have always enjoyed the US, but sadly whilst this is a lovely Hotel, it was our worst choice on any tour of the States.We arrived late, and as a courtesy we readvised the hotel.Upon arrival we were just treated a 'nothings' off the street, and sent to a room. Literally.We had problems with the switches in the room, and were told that is the way it is.I could not recommend this hotel, even for a stopover.",2
140,140,"Warwick has many advantages The Warwick is a good mid tier hotel, we like the location, the balcony doors open - fresh air, even though a bit noisy with the firehall a few blocks away. Exceptional food and service in the dinning room , breakfast and dinner. Entertainers in the lounge in the evening add to the enjoyment of sharing some fine spirits. Grocery store accross the street and Dahalia's one block waay. for lunch or dinner, fabulous desserts. Pool area could use an upgrade. The front desk staff need to smile a little, it goes along way, take a clue from the food service staff.",4
141,141,"The Warwick,Seattle       view from our room",4
142,142,"new york,ny the food was fantastic,the staff very helpful only complaint I asqued for two beds and got one and my view was the wall to the parking lot. p.s. this complaint has nothing to do with the hotel only the neighborhood, I'm from new york and I'm used to deal with every nationality but I had the desplausure of meating(not all)but the most recist people in my life",3
143,143,"Good hotel, good value, great location. Just got back from a weekend in Seattle at the Warwick. Took the grayline airport shuttle and it dropped us off right in front of the hotel. Also picked us up for our return to seatac. Our room had an incredible view of the city skyline, was a fairly good size, with a nice size closet and plenty of drawers for your clothes. Also had a good size desk to work, but the wireless internet was not free and the signal was very weak. The location of this hotel is very convenient, within walking distance of nearly all the sites; pioneer, safeco, and qwest being exceptions. Ralph's grocery across the street was a great added feature, as was dahlia's bakery. It looked like the hotel was on the edge of a transitioning neighborhood, but we never felt unsafe. Walking north of the hotel after dark made me a little uncomfortable, but walking south towards the main shopping district was great with plenty of others out walking. This hotel seemed more European than American. Overall, a great experience. I can definitely recommend the Warwick when travelling to Seattle.",5
144,144,"Not impressed! We booked this 4* hotel on the strength of the recommendations on trip advisor and boy were we disappointed! All our previous selections had been a great sucess, so we thought we'd increase our budget slightly and stay here for 2 nights on our way home. We were travelling with 2 small children (57) so booked one room for us all.The lobby of the hotel is small and gloomy with 2 inconvenient steps down and this just about sums up the hotel. We received a lukewarm welcome at check in (early evening) and a very weak offer of help with parking and our luggage. The room itself was dark with 2 very small double beds, but a view of the spaceneedle. The bathroom was dated (compared to other hotels we had just visited), a pretty pathetic shower and a hole in the ceiling.We asked at guest services for recomendations for children friendly restaurants and the staff shrugged their shoulders until a member of staff called Dave came to help us. He was the most helpful member of staff we came across our entire stay! He gave us directions  even advised us on portion sizes. The other times that we contacted front desk/guest services (very difficult to tell them apart) we were met by unhelpful  unknowledgable staff for very straightforward requests verging on the sarcastic and rude. We enquired about other breakfast restaurants, whale watching tours and pottery barn locations) and we ended up doing our own research and bookings. The standard of housekeeping was not as good as it should have been - the maid didn't remove or replace dirty cups  glasses and wanted to get in our room at 8am on the day we were checking out.We only ate breakfast only once in the hotel, and the waitress (a mature lady) started off by giving our children (who were sitting quitely) a lecture about behaving and being good for their parents. Slow service given a nearly empty restaurant.The hotel is located centrally and we were able to walk to places, but the parking is $27 a day for guests which we thought pricey. We were also told by the front desk that internet access on our laptop was free, but at checkout $11 per day had been added to our bill. When I questioned this, I was told that as I had been 'miss told' they would remove it, but I was made to feel pretty bad about it.Overall, its a dark, dated hotel let down badly by the unhelpful and rude staff. We couldn't believe all the previous excellent tripadvisor reports!",1
145,145,"Great stay at the Warwick We, along with another couple, stayed at the Warwick for 4 nights from 18th May. We had a room with a city view which was very comfortable. The staff were helpful and check-in was easy. The location is very good, within walking distance to shopping and Pike Market. There is a very nice grocery store across the road which is open till 2am and sells everything, even Australian wine. We ate one night in the hotel restaurant. Enjoyable meal. Would definitely stay at the Warwick again",5
146,146,"The Warwick in Seattle adventure Great location which was close to everything.The room was very nice, well maintained and had a wonderful view of the Space Needle.The Business Center was very convenient.The Staff was very courteous and made us feel welcome.Will stay there the next time that we are in town.",5
147,147,"pretty good I stayed at the Warwick in January, on the 19th floor. I had a great view of the city, especially at night! In response to earlier reviews saying the rooms were drafty and cold, I had absolutely no problem with that. If there is one thing I will say about the room, it's that the heating was excellent!Rooms are a little outdated and mine was pretty small, but they're comfortable and clean, so no complaints there. This hotel has an excellent location for many local sights, great restaurants and pubs within walking distance as well.The staff was great and helpful with whatever I needed. Did not use the pool or fitness center. I would have liked to have used the business center, but it was always full.My only complaint was that the food I got from room service had a hair in it. It took awhile for room service to take my order, but the delivery was fast. Nice stay at the Warwick, would stay again.",4
148,148,"below expectations There is nothing really seriously wrong with the hotel, but it just doesn't have any wow factor. Positives: Location is great for exploring the city (sight seeing, shopping, restaurants/clubs/bars), concierge was helpful. Deluxe room was big with a good view (18th floor). Negatives: Decor is very plain, nothing special, worn out. Instead of duvet there a blanket placed between two sheets, swimming pool is very very small but also very very dirty, stuff at reception desk doesn't seem to be happy to work there so you also don't get any feeling you came to a good placeRegarding the price we were paying (from 200 to 260USD per night) we expected a bit more. Didn't get it...",3
149,149,"Perfect I don't typically write reviews on sites, but I saw the last one and wanted to update it...I am physically writing from a room on the 16th floor of the Warwick hotel, visiting here from Hollywood, CA. I've stayed at a couple of hotels during this visit, and I have to say - this is extremely nice.I wanted to comment on the noise comment - I have to say, I think if you're familiar with city noise, this place is actually very quiet. I'm (again) from Los Angeles, so maybe my perspective is a little different, but it's actually a very quiet part of town. There is some construction going on about a block down, but it's during the day and not loud at ALL. I can't hear any of the other rooms, and the heater makes.. Well, the noise a normal hotel heater would make. It's within walking distance of the Space Needle ( and the museums around it), as well as Pike Place Market (and the waterfront). There is a very helpful store right across from it that stays open until 2 AM.. There's also constant cabs waiting outside the front lobby for when you want to visit other parts of the city. Also, if you have the opportunity - and no height issues - I would suggest asking for one of the higher floors - the rooms are all the same up until the suites on the top floor, so it's not pricier to ask for one. The view from either side is amazing - you can choose to have a view of the Space Needle, or of the city (I suggest the city - GORGEOUS).The staff have all been incredibly nice and helpful, and the room is exceptionally clean. Would totally suggest it to anyone!",5
150,150,Noisy The hotel is well located within the downtown core but the traffic and street noise is very loud. We were on the 7th floor and could hear people talking on the street across from the hotel. City buses just waiting at the bus stop could be heard running in the room all night long. Parking was expensive and there was no elevator in the parkade so if you have any mobility problems you need to use the valet parking.,2
151,151,"They made it a special memory I am amazed at how special they made my mom feel. When I booked this hotel, I told them it was for my mom's 60th birthday, and asked simply that someone wish her a happy birthday. Much to my surprise and delight, they did so much more. When we arrived, I was told that our room had been upgraded to a room with a view of the Space Needle - it brought tears to my eyes. Last time we came to Seattle, we stayed at The Fairmont - and while it was nice, it wasn't too special in any way...just nice. This time...well, I'd lost my job earlier this year, so The Fairmont was out of my price range, and the reviews on The Warwick looked like we would have a nice stay; but that was all I was expecting as well. What we experienced was phenomenal - the front desk clerk Lisa Smith not only secured us an upgrade, but when we returned late at night from a day of shopping and a nice dinner, there was a champagne bucket with Martinelli's sparkling cider and two glasses waiting in my room; she also said Happy Birthday on a note, and we found an accompanying cheese/fruit place set beside it as well. Blew me away. I would not hesitate to recommend this place. It is a little older, but it is in a terrific location (amazing restaurants surround it, and two blocks from shopping, plus the new Indiana Jones movie was playing across the street), everything is really clean, with hints of modern furnishings to update it - and of course, most of all, their personal touch made my mom's 60th a memory for us both to cherish. Location location location, tidy, and personal touches; what's not to love...especially when they make your loved ones feel important!?!",5
152,152,"Too Much Traffic Noise I attended a conference and stayed at this hotel for three miserable nights. The lobby and dining areas are fine. The rest of the hotel needs a lot of work. I had a room on the quiet side of the 12th floor. Unfortunately, I don't think there is a quiet side of the hotel. As previous posts mentioned, there was a continuous draft through the sliding glass door since it wouldn't close all the way. I asked to move to another room and was told that all the nonsmoking rooms were booked. The room was so loud from buses and other traffic noise that it sounded like a freight train was going to come through the wall at any time. I've stayed at a lot of hotels on business trips and this was by far the noisiest. The towels and sheets were threadbare. The heater roared loudly, and the room was either hot from the heater or cold from the draft. The conference facilities were drafty and the food was average. The front desk staff had a pleasant appearance but did not seem interested in providing any assistance with dining recommendations, transportation, directions, etc. I asked the bellman for directions to a restaurant and he sent me down the wrong street. This is not a hotel I can recommend for any type of group.",1
153,153,"Watch out for this one! The previous positive reviews must have been from those who were given OUR room. Just hope that you get there to get a room ahead of someone else!We booked this hotel through Hotwire, which was misleading, as it listed this hotel as a Pike Street Market hotel. Not so: it is 5 long city blocks away. It also lists as a boutique hotel which is to make it sound quaint, I guess. Translate it: Old and unrelenting.We called ahead because we specifically needed two beds for medical reasons. I even checked in early to secure a room. I was told by a counter help that your room is locked in for the 14th floor and two beds. We returned at 6 p.m. to be told that because of increased business, our room had been changed to a room with one king bed (very, very small) and a lower floor.Now: I had been told to check in early and that I would get a higher floor room with two beds. Not so. To say that I have a room locked in and then to DOWN GRADE me, is inexcusable. I only regret that I didn't wear my new Trip adviser bill hat! The front desk was very, very rude; cutting my sentences off midway to tell me that it didn't matter what I was told, a crowd had come in and they sold my room. I spent a SLEEPLESS night on a lower floor next to my husband who needed his own bed. How rude. They weren't even apologetic. It was ridiculous. I will never stay here again. Beware: some rooms are very small and outdated and the pool smells like mildew. Seriously. I was basically told because I booked through Hotwire, I wasn't a preferred customer! They don't realize the power of Trip adviser! My recommendation: Save your money! There are several better hotels nearby who appreciate your business and will work with you. It isn't that great of a location, and certainly not worth being treated as if I were pond scum because of using Hotwire (as if people who saved money were stupid). Take my advise: spend your well earned money at King's Motel (1/2 block away) or at the Sheraton or Weston. It was a real bummer staying here!",1
154,154,"Absolutely no complaints! We had researched several different hotels before deciding on the Warwick- we chose it because of the affordable price and location in the city. Upon arriving, we were very pleased. It is in a prime location, a short walk from the market, and very close to shops and restaurants. Our room was spacious, very clean and it had an amazing view of the Space Needle. The bed was unbelievably comfortable. When we were checking out, we noticed we had been charged a fee for using the internet (we had never used it). We notified the people at the front desk and they immediately fixed it, no questions asked. They also offered to get us a cab even though we didn鈥檛 need it. An overall, very satisfactory experience.",5
155,155,"Nice Hotel but.... This is a nice classy hotel which my company booked for me. It has a nice restaurant and the rooms are very comfortable and spacious. If you have the money to spend, this would be a great place to stay. The only thing I did not like about this hotel is they make you use their wireless internet service which you have to pay for. If you have dial up capability, it will work for a while, once they learn that you are using free dial up, they will but a block so you can't dial up. Majority of the staff is nice, but when I stayed there, the person who checked me in was absolutely rude. Check out was very smooth and the Grey Hound Bus stops right outside the hotel to take you to the airport...for a fee of course.",3
156,156,"Great Location  This was our second time staying at the Warwick, the first time we stayed here was a few years ago. Reading the other reviews, I definitely have to agree with alot of them, the hotel is starting to show its age. The location is great, and with Ralph's Grocery Store right across the road, its so convenient! The service there is decent but wasn't memorable. This time we were on the 7th floor and it was so noisy. We were woken up a few times during the nights by so many loud sirens and outside noise. I know this is downtown Seattle, but I never experience it this bad when staying at the Warwick on a higher floor and when staying at Mayflower Park a few blocks down. The room was average, could use renovation. The water pressure in the shower was terrible! Perhaps it was just the floor? I love the restaurant they have there, its such a great place to have breakfast! Excellent service! I would stay here again despite of the noise and the rooms showing their age... but I think next time I'll try another place.",3
157,157,"The best for what you get. Stayed a night at the Warwick over March Easter weekend. Looked through the reviews here and prices of places on expedia previous to travelling from Vancouver and this place looked to be the best value, and it was. We got an even better rate with our Automobile Association membership (AAA or CAA). It was $132/night including all taxes - about a $20 saving over their already reasonable rate (IMO). Parking is an additional $27 but they didn't charge us for this. Basically we were looking for an upgrade to a motel and wanted an indoor pool and hot tub, and wanted to be in the heart of the city. This was it, with pros and cons. We could have stayed at a Quality Inn (1/1/2 stars) for $80/night, or The Sheraton (4 stars) for $210/night. Wasn't drawn to either for reasons of amenities and price respectively.Overall, the biggest pro is what you get more than you pay for IMO: Service well beyond a motel; nice indoor pool and hot tub (you'll find few of these in downtown Seattle), work-out room, newspaper at your door in the morning and invoice slipped under your door on the day you check out, friendly staff, easy early check-in upon our request, a very nice bar - we popped in for a martini - and restaurant which looked nicely run with French flair. Bathrooms are granite and quite clean, although a tad worn. Our room had a great view of the Space Needle.One outstanding feature is the proximity to everything, and this is what we wanted. We walked to everywhere over the 2 days we were downtown. EMP - which was outstanding - is within Seattle Centre as is the Science Centre and the Space Needle. The Science Centre is a must for those with kids; much bigger than Vancouver's Science World with more to do. We also walked to Pike Place Market, and to several restaurants and downtown stores close by. Also, about 3 blocks away from the Warwick is a great jazz bar called Tula's and the area of town (Belltown) has got great character while still being downtown and extremely convenient. Downtown stores were also an easy walk. We walked to Seattle centre, spent the day, then took the monorail (3 minutes ride) to downtown, then walked back to the hotel. A great day.Cons: Only two, but one worth noting for sure. Our room was on the 6th floor of about 25 floors(?) but much too noisy through the night. Not constant traffic, but intermittent busses made things tough. Our kids had no problem sleeping, but I awoke at 4:30 AM and checked our our window to see if it was open, which it wasn't. Next time, I will request a room much higher up which the check-out clerk said was the way to go. One other con was the beds were too small for me (with my wife). Maybe they were doubles(?); fine for the two small kids to sleep together, but we'd like at least a queen, which we are used to. Again, I'll request this next time. Tour tips: Forget the Space Needle. $50 for the family and while the view is awesome, you're up there for about 20-30 minutes unless you stay for a refreshment. Not worth it unless you're dying to see the lay of the land on a very nice day and have $50 burning a hole in your pocket.EMP- Same price as the Needle, but it was 4 hours of great stuff to do. Hands on music experience, as well as a science fiction hall of fame attached. Fabulous for kids or those who are into this. We thought our kids might get bored. They didn't and since we went after 3:30 (it closes at 5) they stamped our tickets to return the next day, which we did. Can't say enough about it.Science Centre: Again, great value and if you're from Vancouver and have a Science World membership, you get in free. But even if you pay the $30 or so for the family, there's lots to see with a great dinosaur exhibit, butterfly room and plenty more.Restaurants: Of course lots in the area, and we loved the Thai food places.Parking; Hotel parking is $27/day and is actually a pretty good deal for central downtown. That gets you parking for your stay and until 5 PM the day you check-out. Very convenient and we didn't bother hunting for a cheaper deal - what would we get elsewhere - $20/day - so why bother? Besides, they forgot to charge us for the parking upon check-in - we didn't notice until check-out and they just said It's on us when we checked out. Very nice.Overall, a very positive experience and we love Seattle. We're happy that we didn't pay the extra for the Sheraton, or go to the Quality Inn for not a lot less. We'd go back to the Warwick with a definite note to advise the staff upon reservation that we are sensitive to street noise, and to place us accordingly - upper floor - which I'm sure they will do.",4
158,158,Handy to everything Pretty comfortable hotel. reasonable positioned so you could walk to most things you wanted to do in Seattle. Didn't dine in the hotel so can't comment but a colleague said the $10 breakfast was sensational value. Staff were helpful and friendly. Free internet access in the business centre which was useful. But as usual wireless access from the room was overpriced.I wouldn't have any hesitation at staying here again,4
159,159,"Needs a rennovation I am glad I got a discount. The room was clean, but nothing special. In fact the bathroom showed a bit of wear. The size and amenities were no different from a good Best Western. Just as noisy too. Maybe that is why there is a discount.The service was average.However, there is a good advantage to this hotel if you have a car. You can park your car yourself and save money doing without valet service. If you approach from Lenora St, however, you have to make two lefts to get to the garage which is to the left of the lobby.The location is great for Belltown, the Federal Courthouse and the town's retail core.",3
160,160,"Nice neighborhood Stayed at the Warwick for a weeklong conference - the room was on a lower floor with a view of a parking lot (and my rate was at least $140-160) - the draftiest room I ever stayed in! A nightly wind across the floor...The neighborhood is perfect - close to everything. Room was clean and the appliances worked. I stuffed the bedspread against the window at night, to lessen the draft. Disappointed that my room rate could not include something nicer, or any view at all, but the city was booked for the conference. (FIX those windows!). Oh, and all I heard all the time was the elevator going up and down... so I didn't have a 'luxury' experience in my estimation.The biggest issue I had was that a housekeeper opened the room, and left the deadbolt in the state that it held the door open. I was staying in a single, came back from my conference, and my ROOM WAS OPEN. Spooked me - I called down after cautiously entering. The manager didn't see fit to come up - just called me back later, asking me if anything was missing. Lucky me, I had forgotten to close the safe, but everything including valuables was still in place. I think the manager could have managed to make an appearance in an instance like this, and I have had experiences in other hotels which were less dramatic, where a manager made an appearance to explain the problem.The restaurant is not good - even breakfasts were hit-or-miss (how do you screw up breakfast?) On the other hand, there are wonderful eateries in the neighborhood - try another venue. The staff in the restaurant were the nicest on staff, though! Oh, and the prices for breakfast in Seattle are shocking - not sure why. On the east coast you can eat like a king for $15 at breakfast - here, I didn't escape for under $22 and didn't necessarily feel full. I was offered a discount on my next stay, after I wrote the chain. But... I cannot imagine a repeat visit to that hotel. If I return to Seattle, I'll be looking for accommodations elsewhere. There are some fabulous hotels (my friends were in them, and some paid no more than I).Seattle's nice people and fun atmosphere were great - if that and a place to sleep are what you're looking for, this could be the place for you.",2
161,161,"Best Value in Downtown Seattle Stayed twice recently, $108 weeknight and $129 weekend. Very nice room, request high floor (book these rooms early, particularly Space Needle view). Room not 5 star, small defects but not enough to mention. Bed, room clean and comfortable. No noise problems as mentioned elsewhere. Front desk staff, Micae, works evenings, very helpful. Parking $25 a night but if you are in and out you may park free on the street after 6 pm usually within a block. Enjoy!",4
162,162,"Decent mid-range hotel, good location We stayed 2 nights with a toddler. The room was fine and quite nice for a 3 star hotel. The location is nice and you can walk anywhere in the shopping area of downtown Seattle, including the market. Across the street was a grocery/deli store that was open late and you could grab food or a coffee. We would stay again.Th only negative were the staff. When we checked in (which was late at night after traveling with a toddler), they gave us a room that was not cleaned. Then we switched rooms and then they gave that room to someone else. When we checked out and caught a taxi early in the morning, no one helped us or even opened a door. There were tons of staff in the lobby (no other clients) and we had a toddler, stroller and LOTS of luggage. The doors are not automatic, so imagine us trying to get out and organized! Not one person even said hello. The lobby is small and they could not have missed us. That was very disappointing.",4
163,163,Comfortable and convenient       View from 16th Floor,5
164,164,"Solid base in Seattle Stayed here for 3 nights just before New Year's Eve. It was easy to find despite the one way system in central Seattle, and in a very convenient location for exploring downtown.Check in had a few problems - the key card system wasn't working so I had to sit and wait in the lobby until this was done. The concierge did offer to let me into the room, however, as I was waiting for my partner to return from parking the car, I took advantage of the comfy seats in front of the log fire. The cards then lost their programming later that evening so we had so trek back down to get them re-programmed. There were no further problems after the first night and the staff dealt with it very efficiently.The room itself was great - comfy bed, lots of space, huge windows, spotless bathroom. Unfortunately, we were in the corner room on the 3rd floor, so it was prone to noise from the street, and the only view was of the cinema across the street! I did ask if we could be moved, but the hotel was fully booked. I guess you have to pay more to get the higher floors, especially at this time of year. The best thing about the hotel was the location. It's just a few blocks walk to the centre of Seattle, with lots of great restaurants and shops within easy reach. We didn't use the car at all during our stay (so we had to pay $27 per day for the privilege of having a car we didn't need - I wouldn't hire a car in future if we were only staying in Seattle, but this was at the end of a skiing trip to Canada, so we didn't have any option but to pay for the parking). We didn't make use of any of the hotel facilities or restaurant, so I can't comment on these. We did use the business centre as this has free internet access as an alternative to paying for in-room wi-fi. Just ask the concierge for this as you need to be let into the room.Overall, it was a comfortable and convenient base, and good value for money. I would stay here again.",4
165,165,"Nice Surprise! We selected the hotel based on the criteria that I was traveling with 2 12-year-old-girls who wanted an indoor pool and to be close to Seattle Center and Pike Market. This narrowed the field, so we chose Warwick. Based on other reviews, I wasn't sure how the hotel would hold up to our expectations; happily, it did. I gave it a 5 because, for the price, there is absolutely nothing more I could have asked for or expected. We arrived in the city by car (crystal clear directions and super easy to get to hotel from I-5 - being a country girl, I'm a little nervous driving my stick shift on Seattle's crowded streets and hills) at 12:30pm. Called the desk from the garage to see if we could check in - No, not yet, but the room would be available at 1:30pm, but we could stay parked in the garage. - Great - At check in a while later the clerk was quick, polite and offered us a map of downtown, some attractions literature and a coupon to Macy's. Another employee walking by, recognized our name (he's the guy I spoke with earlier) and welcomed us and told us he had us in a nice room. Sure enough! when we got to the 14th floor, we had a killer view of the space needle dead in front of us, Lake Washington was off to the right and the Sound off to the left - wow, nice view from our little Juliette balcony! We were in a double/double and if was furnished nicely and clean. And gobs of pillows! - nice touch!After exploring the malls, market and the city, we headed to the pool. While it is true that it is small, I liked that about it - not dungeon - y at all, like another reviewer mentioned. The hot tub was hot and the pool water warm enough. The next morning the girls wanted to get in another swim and I wanted to get in some cardio. Nicely enough, the exercise room is adjacent to the pool and seperated by an all-glass wall. So I got in my 30 minutes of bike riding, all while being able to keep an eyeball on the girls in the pool - nice!An employee caught the elevator with us on the way out of the pool area in the morning and asked the girls how the pool was, they commented that it was nice and even warmer today than yesterday. The man replied something like - Great, I turned up the heat a bit from yesterday - and off he went into the lobby. It is refreshing to see people care about their jobs.Also, maybe because the hotel is unpretenious and makes you feel welcome, the other guests I spoke with at the pool and weight room were very friendly and seemed to be enjoying their stay, as well.At check out, they allowed us to keep the car in the garage until 5pm...another REALLY nice touch!So the Warwick far exceeded my expectations, especially since I booked in at the AAA rate (104) !! Parking was $27 - which is expected for downtown and I got FULL use of it from 12:30 one day to 5pm the next. While the hotel isn't super upscale, it certainly delivers value for the price.",5
166,166,"If you don't mind NOISE, this place is great! I read the reviews about noise, and used the hotel website to book my room. Interesting, their site gives you these checkbox options: 1) Room farthest from the elevator 2) Room on higher floor; 3) Quiet Room. In the interest of getting the QUIETEST room possible, I checked all three hoping to get one of the three. Well, I got on the 6th floor (out of 18-19 floors), across the hall from the elevator, and listened to trucks and ambulance sirens all night!! Sheeeesh!!!!! Aside from that, the heating units sound like small plane engines, and you can hear them from the surrounding rooms.If you can get by all of the noise and are one who sleeps through anything, the facilities are clean, conveniently located, reasonably priced, and the staff quite helpful.",3

168,168,"Loved it! We stayed at the Warwick for an overnight getway and to enjoy some Christmas shopping. The Warwick exceeded out expectations. The staff was wonderful and extrememly friendly, the room was clean and the service at the lounge was wonderful! Everyone we came into contact with at the hotel was very friendly! The women's bathroom on the lever above the lounge was...well.. I think is haunted... totally creepy vibe and the lights... anywho. Even with that, we really enjoyed our stay and are going back in a couple of days!",4
169,169,"Great Location, Great Value I stayed at the Warwick Hotel in November 07. Since I was there for a convention I wanted a hotel that was centrally located where I could park my car and walk everywhere. After comparing rates at the other hotels, I found a terrific rate from seattlesupersaver.com which included parking. After reading other TripAdvisor reviews I was a little nervous about what kind of service I would receive. From the moment I checked in the staff was welcoming, helpful and efficient. I originally was going to stay only 1 night, but enjoyed my stay so much I added another 2 nights. My room was large, clean (and I'm very picky) and comfortable. I ordered room service one evening and it arrived very quickly and I was impressed with the quality and amazed at the portions...huge! Breakfast was not included with my room rate, but there is a great little store/deli across the street that has excellent coffee and inexpensive hot and cold breakfasts. The location of the Warwick can not be beat. You can walk to Pike Place Market, the Convention Center, great shopping and restaurants and the Monorail. I will definitely stay at the Warwick again when I'm in Seattle.",4
170,170,"Great Stay at the Warwick! I just got back from a great girls weekend with my mom. Every year we stay in downtown Seattle and go Christmas shopping. We had never stayed at the Warwick before. I found out about it on Seattlesupersaver.com. Parking is quite expensive, (it is everywhere in Seattle) but it was included in the supersaver deal. The hotel room was good-sized, we had a small balcony and a great view of the Space Needle. It was worth it to pay $50 extra and get a little larger room and view. (I think the total was $149).It was so close to the downtown shopping area that we walked. It was only a few blocks. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to stay at a nice hotel in downtown Seattle but not break the bank.",5
171,171,"Met Our Expectations Centrally located hotel is a few blocks from the water and from popular nightlife and shopping options in Belltown and downtown. I would classify this property as a three star location. We paid a wedding rate so I am not sure how it fares from a value proposition. The room was spacious although a little outdated. Perhaps some rooms have decent views but we were on a lower floor with a drab panaroma of the parking lot and some other buildings. There is an adequate fitness center, sauna and pool in the basement and a quaint bar/restaurant attached to the hotel. Parking at $30 per day is an outrage but possibly standard for downtown (you can find street parking on the weekend to save a few dollars). I would be willing to stay here again the future if the price was significantly lower than the nearby four-star competition.",3
172,172,"Lovely, clean, in the heart of downtown We loved every one of our 4 nights at the Warwick, and laughed all the way to bank at the $104/night rate. While the Warwick looks like your typical Holiday Inn on the outside, it has been completely updated inside with warm, modern decor. We asked for and received a high-floor room with a nice view. Our request for an extra robe was filled within 5 minutes. The staff were attentive and helpful and the room was very clean, warm, and comfortable. We walked to ALL the sights downtown and never needed a car. The Hotel sent Shimsu with his towncar to pick us up at the airport for $35, just $3 more than a cab. Totally worth it.Our only bad experience was trying to catch the regular airport shuttle back to Seatac from the hotel. The Warwick sold us our shuttle tickets the night before our departure, then informed us the next morning that the shuttle wasn't coming because of street closures for the Seattle marathon, then initialy refused to refund our ticket, until we complained loudly.",5
173,173,"ok hotel not so ok staff My mother and I stayed at the Warwick for 2 nights in November. The hotel itself was ok, fairly clean and decent location.The front desk staff, however are not helpful and pass the buck so as not to have to deal with a problem. If they are working on improving customer service , as previous reviews have stated, they have a ways to go.",2
174,174,"Nice Hotel My husband and I stayed at the Warwick about 4 years ago and liked the hotel and location so we did not hesitate to book it again for this trip.We asked for and received a non-smoking room with a king bed and high floor. We were hoping to be on the same side of the hotel as before and we were - with a nice view of the Space Needle. Check-in was nice and friendly. Had our keys within minutes and a nice room with a small loveseat and a Juliet balcony.Love the location of this hotel - just a block away from some of the best restaurants downtown (Dahlia Lounge, Palace Kitchen, and Lola's) and a small grocery store/mini-mart right across the street that also has wine. It's also an easy walk to Pike Place Market.On site at the hotel is a very nice restaurant and lounge area. Ate breakfast at the hotel once and had drinks in the lounge/bar a few times. Good service.We didn't have a chance to use it but we did look at the pool and exercise room which is located in their basement. Pool was small but definitely useable. The exercise room had a variety of machines and weights - not the newest on the market but definitely decent machines. Both were kept very neat and clean and the exercise room had plenty of towels and a water cooler available.I think we ran into the maid on most days as we were leaving and she was always very friendly.We used the business center a couple of times which consisted of 2 computers (free internet) and a printer. You just needed to ask for the key at the front desk. Was very nice and handy.Overall, I thought the staff was very helpful, the hotel was quiet with a good location, and it definitely met all of our expectations as it did when we stayed here a few years ago. We would definitely return again (and hope that we do soon!)",4
175,175,"ok experience. a few warnings. after booking thru expedia, i read some reviews and was concerned about the Warwick. I was wondering what i was getting myself into. The hotel is older, but i found it clean. Front staff are really trying to improve their customer service. Errors upon checkin. They gave me a single bed when i asked for seperate queen beds. They told me no rooms available. They offered to bring an extra cot. When i was settling into room, front staff said they located a two queen room and so i was moved.Package was to include free parking but i was charged for valet parking which i'm in dispute with the Warwick about. I'lll see what they do about it.Would i stay again? Hard to say. Room was quiet and clean. Nothing spectacular. I'd give it a better rating if there wasn't so many errors with the bill and checkin, but they seem to be trying and sometimes that's all you can ask for.",2
176,176,"Very Good Hotel Not a large hotel but newly decorated. Rooms are a good size and very clean. Excellent location, less than 2 blocks from the centre of town and only 4 blocks to the market area.Hotel resturant is a bustling place with alot of diners coming from off the street. Had a very good meal there.Overall, I would highly recommend staying there.",4
177,177,Average hotel with a great view       View from our window,3
178,178,"Bad Room I was pleasantly surprised that I was given a room with a king-size bed, so I was off to a good start, but that soon ended. The bed sheets were old and felt like they were poorly washed. The room had a very poor shower that trickled out water. Plus they had rigged some type of showerhead using a bath faucet. The drain was slow and you waded around in the shower water even with the poor water flow from the shower. One side of the room is all window with a patio window...not much of a view. So with the window also came all the city noise. Unfortunately, the fan settings for the room were either Off or Automatic so it did not help to drown out the city and hotel noise. It was slightly cool outside and the cold air just poured in from the bottom seal of the patio window. The hotel does have a good selection of local beers and wines. The food was okay but very over priced, as you will find throughout the downtown area. The best meal I had was at the Seattle Tap Room in the airport. Beware, if you use the Grayline for transportation, allow plenty of time, as they ran up to an hour late.",2
179,179,"Love on the 14th Fkloor The Warwick is a great spot on the north edge of downtown.Convenient Parking Grage next door, restaurant and bar on premises.We found the staff to be friendly and helpful.Our room was a Space Needle view and you could not have asked for a better nightlight.It was also located close to two of our favorite eateries, the Palace Kitchen and the Icon Grill.",5
180,180,A Hidden Gem! I found my whole experience at the Warwick fantastic! The staff were helpful and kind. The rooms were beautiful and a good value for the location. Brasserie Margaux (located in the WarwicK) serves delicious meals. I really enjoyed my stay,5
181,181,"Warwick was a wonderful ""home away from home"" We are relocating to the Seattle area, and thought that the Warwick would be a good place for us to stay while we were house hunting. Returning to the Warwick after a day out with the realtor was just what my husband and I needed.The staff were always welcoming upon our return, and very helpful in answering all of our questions.Our room was lovely, clean and comfortable, with an absolutely spectacular view of the Space Needle.The location is perfect for walking almost anywhere, and we enjoyed many delicious meals in the Brasserie Margaux Restaurant. We especially liked their crabcakes and the tapas selection at Happy Hour.The Hotel was decorated for the Fall season, which added to to the warm, welcoming atmosphere.We did find a home in Seattle, but hope to come back to the Warwick for a weekend getaway once we are settled. We also now know where we will be putting up all of our out of town guests. Thanks to the Warwick Staff in making our first few days in Seattle such pleasant ones!",4
182,182,"Worst Hotel Ever!!! We stayed at the Warwick for a night in October. Our original room reeked of smoke and so we were downgraded (they said that at the front desk) to the 6th floor. Our room was small and poorly furnished and stocked (no microwave, fridge etc.). They charged us more than the quoted price, but the confirmation email I received only contained the confirmation #, not the price, so we have been fighting this for 7 days now. To top it all off, we were charged for 2 nights! $487.51 total--it is not worth the money at ALL. We've been calling the hotel nightly and every employee we speak to is unable to fix the problem; we've been getting passed from manager to manager and department to department and we have to repeat our story and prove ourselves over and over again, despite being promised that it will be fixed immediately--I promise. This is, by far, the worst customer service experiences we've EVER had.",1
183,183,"Worst experience with a hotel! I was in Seattle for my best friends wedding and she had reserved a block of rooms at this hotel. My husband and I checked in Friday night, along with another couple, intending to stay two nights. When we checked in, we were told that our room would be a different price than what we were quoted. I questioned the woman checking us in and she said we needed to have the confirmation number. I printed off the confirmation number and showed it to her. She then told me that the confirmation number was not enough, and that I needed to have the price I was quoted in writing. I did not have time to deal with that right away ( I had to get ready for the rehearsal and grooms dinner.) So, we ran up to our room to get ready. When I opened my hotel room door, the smell of smoke was overpowering. I immediately returned to the front desk because I had definately not booked a smoking room. The woman at the desk told me that my room was not a smoking room, but the floor underneath my room was smoking and it must have drifted up. !?! I asked her what she could do for me, and quickly because I needed to get ready and go. After she debated with a couple other employees I was told I could wait 40 minutes while they cleaned it or check into a room on the 6th floor (no view) which was a downgrade from my 15th floor with a view.I had no other choice than to take the downgrade.I asked to speak with a manager, no one was available.I asked to speak with the person that I had originally booked my room with. I was told I could call the front desk and asked to be connected to her, if she was in.We stayed the night, in the 6th floor room, and the fan in the bathroom was broken! The next day, I reported the broken fan, and again asked to speak with a manager. I was told the manager on duty was on lunch break,but I could leave my cell phone number and they would call me.I never recieved a call.We all checked out after the one night, telling the person at the desk that we were extremely dissatisfied.The staff seemed very uncaring. I asked for directions to the Marriot by the water, they could not give me directions. I asked them to look it up on mapquest for me, they couldn't do that either.I just looked at my bank statement and realized they have charged me for 2 nights! I will have to call and figure this out now.This hotel is a joke, and it is not even nicely decorated. It seems run down and old. The bride had the suite on the top floor, and even that room wasn't amazing. The furniture was marble, but chipped and looked out dated. I would never stay at a Warwick again!",1
184,184,"Good location, staff could have been more helpful The location of the hotel is good - fairly close to everything. The rooms were clean and we had a balcony and a great view of the Space Needle (I'd recommend asking for a space needle view, if you book). The price was alright as well, at least in comparison to other hotels in Seattle.... Problems: There isn't a moderate / good for family restaurant in the hotel and it is hard to find these in the hotel neighborhood as well, unless you just want fast food. (There is a small grocery/wine store across the street that is open until late, which was really nice!) The staff was not friendly, nor helpful. The front desk was unable to give us walking directions to the wharf (I would have thought a lot of people would have asked for that...). There was also problems with getting a late checkout - because our flight out was at 6pm, I had emailed the hotel before we left for Seattle to get a late check-out. The hotel had responded that, that wouldn't be a problem. When we checked in, the front desk clerk said we had to ask the night before we check out. When I asked that night, he said we had to call down in the morning....just extra unneccessary hassle. Overall, I'd stay somewhere else on my next trip.",2
185,185,"Fabulous! We had stayed at the Warwick mostly because of its central location (in the heart of downtown and close to Qwest field), and figured with its reasonable price and free shuttle - why not try it? Even before we had arrived at the hotel we received great customer service! Well, we were lost (google directions weren't very good) and it was dark, so we called the hotel and the lady who answered the phone stayed with us on the phone directing us to the hotel until we dropped our car off with the valet. The parking may be pricey, but the free shuttle service the hotel has, more than made up for the cost! Also, because we were in downtown we walked to Macy's, Bed Bath  Beyond and to the mall. The restaurant in the hotel was very good! But a tip - make reservations for Sunday brunch because it gets quite busy. The service was great, the rooms were very comfortable and clean. The water pressure was lacking but that was the only con during the whole trip. We had a paper delivered to our door every morning...what can I say except that we have already booked another trip to Seattle this November and we are of course staying at the Warwick again!",4

188,188,"Good choice in Seattle I stayed one night here on business, booked by my company. Overall, it was satisfactory, I arrived late evening, the room on the 17th floor was clean and comfortable, with a great view. The bathroom was a little on the small side, but clean and well equipped. After a good night's sleep I enjoyed an excellent breakfast in the restaurant before checking out. All staff I encountered were friendly and polite.",4
189,189,"Good value, central location My husband, our two children and I stayed here for four nights in July. We had a lovely view of the Space Needle and the Cinerama (a big hit with kids) across the street. The hotel is close to Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square, Tom Douglas' Lola and Dahlia Lounge (a block away), the monorail to Seattle Center, shopping, etc. The pool isn't huge, but it was clean and cool and the kids loved it. The little Juliet balconies for each room are a nice touch as, if you're on a high floor, you can leave the door wide open all night for a welcome breeze. Check in was easy and the staff members were all very pleasant. I'd stay here again.",4
190,190,"Great value! My husband and I took a day trip to Seattle earlier this month and we were having a HORRIBLE time trying to decide where to stay. We didn't want to have to pay a lot for the hotel and parking. We ended up decided on the Warwick because the AAA rate was $113. Parking was an addition $20, so all in all we ended up spending just under $150 for the night. I was nervous about staying here because I'd read some of the reviews on tripadvisor. Admittedly, when we first arrived, we were a bit put off by a rude desk clerk! However, the individual that checked us in was very nice (he gave us tips on where to eat, best way to get to the monorail, and just a general overview of downtown Seattle). I am probably writing this review because I left an item in our hotel room. I was really worried because I didn't know if I'd be able to get it back. (If you must know it's my childhood pillow). At any rate, the hotel contacted my husband to let him know that they had my pillow and wanted to know where to send it.!!! They sent my pillow and I can now rest easy!The beds were comfortable, and we had a pretty decent view of the city. So, I'd say the room was about a 4 out of 5. It's in a really good location, about 3 blocks to Pikes Peak, 4 blocks to the actual waterfront, and 6 blocks from the Space Needle. So you're definitely in walking distance to some major tourist attractions. The price was extremely good for a downtown hotel!",4
191,191,"Great Location, expensive parking The Warwick is in the heart of Seattle easy walking distance to Pikes Place, the Monorail terminal and Downtown Shops. We stayed twice recently at the start and finish of a tour of the Pacific North West. Staff are very helpful and knowledgable, rooms are large and comfy except that they only have one armchair in a large two bedded room. Rooms have fridge and coffee maker.Parking is on site, it is expensive, but I guess it reflects city centre parking prices. It is in the Free Zone for travel on Seattle's buses so it is very cheap (free) to travel around central Seattle, and there is a handy grocery store opposite",4
192,192,"A Pleasurable Experience We stayed here for 5 nights last month. The initial impression was poor - being told that we could not get help with the bags as 鈥渂oth trolleys were in use鈥? I was left to find a trolley myself at the parking garage and be my own bellman. Thereafter things got better - we had a very spacious room on the 17th floor with a great view of the Space Needle, service in the restaurant was OK although the air conditioning in the bar could do with being turned down - it was like sitting in a fridge. The only other glitch was with the bill - our rate included parking but it had been added on to the bill. Overall, however, a pleasurable experience and I would not hesitate to recommend the Warwick.",4
193,193,"We love this hotel! My Husband and I have stayed here one more than one occasion and we love it more every time! The restaurant, bar and location is fantastic! I can't wait to go back again!",5
194,194,"Noise of airconditioner-a standard? We arranged our stay through a travel agency and unfortunately Warwick Seattle Hotel was the only dissapointment through our trip. During our 3 night stay in Warwick, we changed 3 rooms. Starting from the first minute of our stay, hotel personnel didn`t make us feel like a guest but more like an intruder. They were very reluctant to help and solve complaints. The hotel is right at downtown and 5 minutes to really good restaurants but this seems like the only good thing about it. Although there was availability, the first room they offered was at 2nd floor and our window was directly opening to the car parking at the same level. So we changed the room. In all 3 rooms, there was a loud sound coming from the air conditioner/ heating system which we found unbelievable for an hotel. The hotel personnel told that it is a standard noise for all rooms. So, we tried to avoid using it during the night in order to sleep and if possible only while we were watching TV loudly.",1
195,195,"A Real Disappointment We stayed three nights, had a double room on the 7th floor. Upon check in the staff was not really welcoming. Bed linens are low quality, torn blankets, thin and worn flat sheet thrown over a thin, felt like pad on bottom mattress. We were there Thursday through Sunday, by the time we left Sunday, our trash container was stacked about 2 feet tall with trash that had not been removed from the room since the first day (newspapers, pizza boxes, plastic bags, paper cups). I kept pulling it further into the room each day, thinking they couldn't possibly miss it again. They did. Even though the hotel went through a renovation not too long ago, the rooms are pretty dated. Parking was expensive, $21 per day, plus wifi at $9 per day. with sales tax over 15% added on, it was not an inexpensive hotel. I remember seeing it rated as 4 star. I'd probably say more like 2.5 star. Parking for guests is on levels 4 and above. Yet, there is no elevator in the garage. Location of the hotel is very good, and although we did not try them, the bar/restaurant seemed pretty busy. Bottom line....we were not impressed with either the service or the hotel itself, and will definitely stay elsewhere next time we are in Seattle.",2
196,196,"Avoid If At All Possible I'm not a terribly critical person, but I really hated this hotel. It has some good points - for example, it's cheaper than other options in downtown Seattle and it's in a decent location. (It's not in the center of downtown like the other hotels, but it's only a 5 or 6 block walk).However, those are the only positives. The rooms are very dark and the furniture is really old and mismatched. This gives the impression of it being dirty as soon a you walk in. As far as cleanliness, it was just okay - it's the kind of place that makes you feel as though you need to check the sheets before crawling into bed. The blankets were really, really worn, but the sheets seemed clean. Everything else was a crap shoot.My biggest problem with the room was that it was freezing. They have these balconies, which are not meant for actually standing on, which were very drafty and made the room unbearably cold. I turned up the thermostat, but it didn't help. And when it actually kicked on , the smell that came out of the vent was disgusting. It smelled like mold and mildew. We actually turned off the heat and froze just so we wouldn't be subjected to the smell.Anyway...I thought this hotel would be okay since I was not planning on being in it very often and I really just needed a convenient location to sleep. Now that I've stayed there I realize it would have been just as cost effective to spend a little more and stay somewhere that provided some comfort. The Warwick charges $23, (I think), for parking and $12 for internet /per day. By the time you add all the extras, I could've stayed at the Red Lion or Hotel Monaco for only slightly more. If you're going to Seattle, look hard at spending a little extra for another hotel - and you'll probably even end up right in the center of downtown.",2
197,197,"So so Stayed here for two nights as part of a tour package. The location is great and the hotel has a good restaurant. However, some of the staff seemed to be haughty. The pillows were hard and lumpy, bedding needs to be replaced. The room was stuffy as the ventilation fan switches off whenever the room temperture approached the temperture set on the thermostat. There was no way to override this feature.",2
198,198,"Great Stay in Seattle I checked rates all over and found GReat Rates on the hotel web page which included breakfast for $132 per night for Friday and Saturday night. The location is great, we could walk to anywhere and it was also 2 blocks from the Monterail. The buses are free all over town if you don't want to walk. The staff was helpful. Ask for a room with space needle view. Small but very clean room and beds. cute little balcony. The continental breakfast had fresh fruit and crusants with a small pot of great coffee. Take a taxi from the airport when you arrive. They are also everywhere around the hotel with no waiting around. I made the mistake and booked the downtown airporter shuttle. This is a bus that makes a bunch of stops and is full. have fun.",5
199,199,"Nice view, Nice accomodations Having never been to Seattle, I am pleased with the Warwick and my stay there. The staff was amicable and fast--there were always at least 3 people at the front desk. The lobby also has a nice lounge area with a fireplace. They also have a business center with 2 computers with internet access and a printer (free use of all when I was there). My only complaint is the jaccuzi was out of service and being worked on in the pool area (which is in the basement), and the construction zone atmosphere down there was unpleasant. Room service and the food was excellent and fast.If you book a room, ask for a space needle view--I stayed on the 6th floor in a corner room and had a nice view. Plus, it was fairly quiet and I never heard noise (i.e. someone else's loud TV) except for the occasional bus route on the street below. If you don't mind walking, you are only a couple blocks from Westlake shopping center and a few blocks from Pike's Marketplace. Across the street is a gourmet market--Ralph's--that stays open 'till midnight, and a bakery called Dahlia's--known for their coconut cream pie.And best of all, I booked this room on Expedia for a mere $105/night. You won't be smack in the center of everything, but a little walking will get you to the main tourist spots. I felt relaxed and comfortable there--I recommend it.",4
200,200,Home in the city Excellent value. A very warm place to stay. You can sit in the lobby and feel like you are in your own home reading the paper or you can join others in the lounge or restaurant in the hotel. It's quiet at night and the beds are very comfortable. We went to a fantastic Italian restaurant virtually next door where we were greeted and served like part of the family. We walked home from a movie at 12:45am and felt very safe in the area. This is will definitely be our first choice when staying in Downtown Seattle. If this hotel could be mimicked in every other major city in the world for value and comfort every other hotel chain would be out of business.,5
201,201,"Cool hotel, terrible service The Warwick is located in Belltown, an interesting neighborhood with some fabulous restaurants. It has a nice lobby and the rooms were pretty clean. The front desk, however, was a horror show. We had asked for a pot of coffee to be delivered at 6am every morning, as we needed to be up and out by 7. On the third morning, we did not get our coffee, and consequently arose an hour late. And in Seattle of all places! On two separate occasions we asked for the so-called complimentary transportation. Upon the first request, we were told we would have to wait at least a half hour and that we should take a taxi. The second time we asked for transportation we were told our destination was too far away. The point is - don't advertise the service if there are caveats that go with it. The front desk staff was aloof and not interested in reparing the harm, and for that reason alone I would not stay there again. But I do intend to return to Seattle - great town!",2
202,202,"Warwick is ok I stayed at the Warwick hotel 26-28 Jan. I chose it because it was close to Seattle Center where I was attending the Travel Convention. The hotel is ok. Nothing spectalular. The front desk people are friendly though twice when my sister and I asked for directions, the ladies we asked had to go find the manager to ask her. The room we stayed in on the 17th floor was clean. It had a gorgous view of downtown Seattle. The only problem with the room was the lighting was very poor in the bathroom and the handle on the toliet fell off when I flushed so you had to be very careful. But the room was quiet and comfortable. The only other problem we encounter was in our search for a working ice machine. This hotel has 19 floors but only 4 ice machines..17th, 15th, 8th and 4th floor. The one on the 17th floor was out of order, the one on the 15th floor was out of order but Eureka! the one on the 8th floor was working so all wasn't lost. In summary, for the price I paid, it was an adequate hotel with a good location.",3
203,203,"We had a great stay here! We booked a room here over thanksgiving weekend with 2 small kids. The location was great! You could walk to everything. We walked to a great coffee house called Cherry Street every morning for coffee and breakfast then went to the museums and space needle then took a cab back to the hotel since it was very cold. One night my husband had a meeting to go to so me and the 2 kids walked around to the merry go round and macy and to pf changs for dinner where by the way we had a wonderful and I mean wonderful time eating greasy Chinese food. We even walked into macy's and got a santa picture of my two kids. No one was there and no line to wait it. What luck and timing. The kids rode on the merry go round and we walked back to the warwick and felt safe and sound. We did eat at the restaurant in the lobby one night and it wasn't good at all. Try one of the restaurants next door/down the street. They all looked so good. Next time we will. Warwick is great for the location, clean, good rates, nice pool, gym and valet parking (parking is a lot but a lot everywhere in seattle hotels).",4
204,204,"Great Location Comfortable Room My Brother and I booked direct on the internet. The cab from the airport cost $38. On arrival at the Warwick we were given a warm friendly welcome at reception. We requested a high floor room and we were given a great room on the 14th floor, right on the corner with a city view. Two large double beds, all the amenities you would expect. Powerful shower, coffee making facilities and tv all worked perfectly. The dining room served a delicious menu and was presented very well. The dining room was always buzzing as it also led into the bar area. Served wonderful cocktails. Ralphs deli was right opposite and sold milk, wine and foods.The best part of staying at the Hotel was its easy walking distance to the city. All the main stores like Macys, Nordstrom and Pike market were just minutes away. The staff were very attentive and let us have free use of the Hotels internet in its business office.Sadly our flight was cancelled and we needed a Hotel for another night. We called the Hotel from the airport to ask they accommodate us. Being New years eve it was full but as we were previous guests they managed to find us a room. We even managed to welcome the new year with the spectacular firework display at the space needle. Definitely will return again.",5
205,205,"Great hotel for the money Can't beat the Warwick for cost in Seattle. We were forced to stay here after our power was out for over a week at home. Being a native I know Seattle. The location was great, 3 blocks up from Pike Place, just a 4 or 5 blocks over from the Space Needle. We got the winter special, and got a corner room with a direct view of the needle, and Lake Union to the right, on the 15th floor for $100/night. The hotel was renovated, but there is still plenty left from the original 1984 building. The windows are old, and a bit drafty, the street noise, as in all big cities, is constant. We turned up the heat and did just fine. They offer all the things an expensive hotel does, witha great view, for a great price. We would definately stay there again, I'm not going to pay 200/night + to stay anywhere else in Seattle, when the Warwick is available.The restaurant next door, Assiago, was not worth the money, despite reading a good review we were disappointed. There are many better places to eat nearby.",3
206,206,"Good Hotel - Bad Wifi This hotel completed extensive renovations in 2006 and the rooms are lovely. Although the rooms are modern, the hotel has the feel of a traditional hotel. The staff are all well dressed and well mannered and very professional. The location is convenient and there is a small gourmet supermarket across the street open until 1AM.  As other reviewers have mentioned, however, street noise is a factor to be considered. The hotel has floor-to-ceiling single glazed windows and even on the 8th floor, trucks and buses could be heard at all hours of the day. Seattle is a very hilly city which adds to the vehicular noise. Most importantly, if you are planning to use the wi-fi internet access, BEWARE. It's about $10 per day but the signal strength is super weak and inconsistent. I had to stand next to my room door to get a halfway decent signal - at the desk there was almost no signal. Hotel staff acknowledge this and have a LAN conversion kit which didn't work either. Bottom line, if internet access is a factor, stay elsewhere.",2
207,207,"A perfect location The Warwick is a perfect location for those who like very comfortable surroundings, a friendly and helpful staff, and close proximity (walking distance) to Pike Market, shopping of all kinds and performances at the Paramount, Moore or Jazz Alley.",5
208,208,"Great Location - Nothing Really Fancy On a whole our stay at the Warwick was pretty nice. I think the best part of the hotel is the location (walking distance to most attractions downtown) and the fact that they are a little cheaper than most other hotels in the area. If you go, don't expect a large fancy hotel. Request a high floor (7th or higher) for a view. The food and room service aren't really that great but there are some eating options that are very close.",3
209,209,"Enjoyed the Warwick very much... Arriving from Staten Island, NY, we stayed at the Warwick in September, 2006, pre-cruise to Alaska, for 2 nights. We were celebrating our 25th Anniversary on the day of our arrival. The people at the front desk, the concierge and the restaurant were wonderful. The Brasserie Margaux Restauant was excellent and we were so pleased that we had decided to have our anniversary dinner there. Chef Zarkdes knew it was our anniversary, the food was so delicious and he made sure that we had exceptional service from his best waitress, Janice. Charlotte, the concierge, was really helpful with booking our bus tour of Seattle and a car to the Cruise Ship dock. Our room was more than adequate and we found it quite comfortable. We splurged and ordered room service for breakfast and it was delightful. On the whole our experience at the Warwick was very pleasant and enjoyable.",4
210,210,"Good Location,Poor Cleanliness The Warwick Hotel has a great location in Seattle. Close to shopping, PIke Place and the Seattle Centre. However what really lets this hotel down is it cleanliness. The bed linen was torn, bottom of curtains were torn and the floor had a few stains. The hotel advertises itself as having a balcony ,which in reality is a disappointment. We stayed in a hotel in San Diego which did have a balcony - table, chairs etc. The Warwick balcony is about 10 inches.The view from rooms with a view of the Space Needle is terrific, but doesn't make up for the poor cleanliness. The check in staff were neither pleasant nor unpleasant and we decided not to sample the restaurant. Ralph's deli across the street is great for snacks and also has a cafe.There are plenty other better hotels in Seattle for the same or slightly more money than the Warwick - choose one of them e.g The Hotel Andra.",2
211,211,"Warwick was a great choice! My first trip to Seattle. I selected the Warwick based on reviews here (and it was a package available from United), and I was not disappointed. I found the staff to be quite friendly and knowledgeable. My room on the sixth floor was clean and comfortable (in fact, the first night there, I fell asleep early, with my clothes on, and stayed that way all night)! I ate in the restaurant, and the waitress nudged me away from my first choice, and gave me a thumbs up on my second choice (I asked for her advice), a delicious rigatoni dish with artichokes and olives. Their bread is especially wonderful! The location is convenient for walking; the hotel provided a very helpful map. I used the Grayline shuttle from the airport and back, which was so easy. I'd certainly stay at the Warwick again.",4
212,212,"Good Location, but... My sister and I stayed in a two double bed room on the third floor (305) We requested a room on a higher floor, but none were available upon check-in. I've read reviews you can hear street noise on the lower floors. The room was very noisy and I couldn't get any sleep. If you're a light sleeper, go with a higher floor if you can get one. Room was nice (at time of walk in), but small. Bathroom was small as well and didn't have enough towels for two people. When we closed the curtains, I noticed several stains. They were dark reddish brown in color. I'm assuming they were blood stains. I was disgusted. The phone's earpiece was visibly dirty and there was a hair in the bathtub, before we used it. I left my comments about the room with management and haven't heard back.Location was great, close to shopping and the market. Parking was $21 a night, but a good deal since other lots are pricier and street parking is scarce. Check out is at noon and parking was good until 5pm. There is a grocery store across the street and a starbucks and seattle's best coffee 2 -3 blocks up on Lenora. We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant. Food was good and service was great! Seattle Times paper was delivered every morning. Internet service is not included in the price of the room and cost $10 a day. If you're looking for restaurants in the area try The Icon Grill on 5th and Virginia and the Pink Door at Post Alley, 1st and Stewart.",2
213,213,"Good place without spending big bucks The Warwick was plenty comfortable and nice for us. We had a nice view of the Space Needle from our room. Don't expect a balcony. There is just an 18 inch ledge with ironwork to keep you from falling overboard. But you can open the patio door and partially step out for a view of Lake Union and Elliott Bay. The last morning we were there, the top of the Space Needle was hidden by clouds. It was neat to see it in sunny weather and cloudy. We had everything we needed at the Warwick. No complaints.",4
214,214,"Nice hotel This was our first trip to Seattle and we wanted stay downtown. We had a good rate for the hotel  decided to stay at the Warwick. It was very clean, and we stayed on the 17th floor which had an excellent view of the Space Needle  downtown. It was nice to be able to open up the sliding door and let the cool air in. The bed was comfy but the pillows were not. The room was clean, parking was not a problem if you use the hotel parking. The staff was friendly  helpful. You had to ask for a key to the business center and there were only 2 computers. Needless to say it was a hassle to use the computers  to acquire the key. The restaurant was very good for breakfast. The hotel is not within walking distance to major attractions like it stated. The space needle  Pike's market are about 20 mins away (walking) so we opted to drive there.We were pleased with the hotel and would stay there again.",4
215,215,"Warwick Seattle Stayed at the Warwick on October 7 and 8, after booking through Expedia. It's a good hotel for the price, with nice rooms, restaurant, and pool/hot tub. The location is perfect, as you can park your car (Seattle is a CRAZY city to drive in) and walk everywhere.Only one problem with the stay. We were on the 8th floor, with a great view of the Space Needle. Late on Saturday night, the entire floor suddenly erupted in one huge party. The noise was incredible, as a large group of young people (not sure if they were high school or college age) were running up and down the hall, in and out of rooms with doors slamming, knocking on doors - including ours - and yelling and throwing things from the balcony to the street below. After several calls to the front desk, we asked to move to a different floor which, in spite of the hassle of having to pack our bags and relocate in the middle of the night, resolved the issue a(t least for us). We got a note of apology in our new room, along with a voucher for breakfast.I travel quite a bit, and have never run into this before. I'm not sure what a hotel can do in this situation - maybe some hotel owners or managers could explain what the policy is? One of the problems was apparently that there were several floors where the same thing was happening, and the hotel security was overwhelmed. The front desk clerk told me that as long as the guests were in their rooms, they were 'following hotel noise policy', which doesn't seem reasonable to me, if correct. In this case, it was more than simple rowdiness or high energy. I heard a voice from the next balcony saying 'Hey, don't -- on those people on the street!'! As well, when we finally did get a new room, the route to the elevator was blocked with a mass of people - on the floor, couples making out against the walls, people running up and down the hallways etc. Anyone have similar experiences or thoughts on this? Or, if you're a parent of someone who was on a school trip to Seattle over the Columbus Day weekend, and your child was staying at the Warwick, you might want to ask some pointed questions! Anyway, the hotel itself was fine, great location, reasonable price. Parking anywhere in Seattle is expensive, but at the Warwick there was secure parking available, and the location was easy to get to and leave from.",3
216,216,"Liked this place, good location Stayed here for three nights in September 2006. The room was very comfortable, nice bed and clean bathroom. Found chocolates in my room upon arrival-nice touch. Other reviewers have mentioned that the rooms can be a bit noisy because of street noise. That's because you have a wall of windows - gives a great view but not totally soundproof. Ask for a room on an upper floor facing the Space Needle, there are 16 floors. I stayed on the 10th floor and had no problem with outdoor noise. Hotel is on 4th Avenue with lots of great restaurants nearby and a 10 minute walk to Pike Place market and shopping. Great bakery just a block away and a movie theater across the street. Shuttle bus from airport stops at the corner. The hotel is nice but not as nice as some other hotels in the downtown (but probably not as expensive either). Still, I would come back for another stay.",4
217,217,"don't recommend Stayed here for 2 nights last week. Had a confirmed reservation via hotel website (with a printout in my hand), but the front desk says the room is not available. Waited for about 20 minutes and a room became available, although not the type I reserved.My rate included continental breakfast, but had to tell the front desk again who finally gave me the vouchers. My room was on the 16th floor facing the Space Needle. You can hear a lot of noise from the street until late night.Overall, I would not recommend this hotel.",1
218,218,"Not Bad........ We had a post stay at the Warwick after an Alaskan Cruise. We stayed pre-cruise at a different establishment. Checkin is at 3pm. we arrived earlier and they were happy to store our luggage and told us we should have rooms ready by 11:30 or 12:00. They were. We however were given wheelchair accessable rooms so I can't comment on the regular accomodations. The rooms are average size and comfortable, although the bed frame sticks out a bit on the ends leading to stubbed toes if you get too close. The bed was comforatble, and the room contained all the ammenities you would expect. TV, alarm clock, coffee maker, mini-bar. There are small balconies with sliding doors. The decor is typical of a high rise hotel, but the leather headboard makes a statement. Ice machines are available on four floors only.The pool and gym are located in the basement. THe pool is small and 3 feet deep, but very nice. The hot tub was broken so I cannot comment on it. The gym is well stocked with equipment and towels. There is also a two person sauna available. The mens room has lockers and showers for changing. Although I went to turn on the shower and the fixture fell off. I was blasted back into the wall by a stream of hot water.The bathroom was set up with a handicap shower, no tub, and a hand spray fixture which had very little water pressure.The hotel is VERY convenient to shopping and walking around. There is a shuttle to the airport for 10.25 per person that leaves every :25 and :55 on the hour. It takes about 25 minutes to get to the airport and is very comfortable. I did notice the staff recommending the private car service to the airport for $35.00 but this is about the same if not more than taking a cab, especially after tipping the driver. I leave that to personal opinion.Would I stay here again.....Most likely not. Although the staff was friendly, and the restaurant good, the hotel lacked the comfort and personality factor that I look for when I travel.",2
219,219,"Great value in Seattle Myself and spouse stayed at the Warwick Seattle for four days in September. This hotel does not disappoint as a reasonably priced stay in the downtown area. It's an easy walk to all sightseeing attractions (five blocks from the waterfront) and there is a free bus in Seattle but we could never figure out how that worked (do some research before you go!!). Our room (king bed) was spacious and nicely appointed, very comfortable and with plenty of pillows. The coffee in the room of course was great (this being Seattle). The bath is finished in marble with a deep tub and hand-held shower which was a nice touch. Toiletries were below average but that's not a huge consideration for us. Our only complaints concerned the front desk. I had made two reservations: one for the first part of our trip and one for the third leg (after Olympic Penninsula) but decided to cancel the second reservation. When we arrived at the hotel after a full day of travel the desk clerk kept us waiting for several minutes without so much as a hello. We moved to the second desk clerk when she was free and were told that our reservation could not be found. No attempt was made to look for it. We had to walk up the stairs to the parking garage and get our confirmation from our luggage and only then did they find the reservation. The following day my office tried to call and was told that we weren't staying there. Parking is $21/day which is pretty steep but the only option because parking in Seattle is scarce. The hotel doesn't have a shuttle so the only other option was a cab which is about $30.The hotel restaurant is adequate but for a really great breakfast walk a block to the Mayflower Park Hotel (pricey but fabulous).",4
220,220,"Good location, room was OK We stayed here on the last few days of our Pacific Northwest honeymoon. The rooms were large, but the bathrooms small. Very convenient to walk to most sights in Seattle, but watch out for those hills. The complimentary shuttle is for a 2 mile radius and is free drop off, no pick up, but they did take us to the Pyramid Brewery one night which is right next to Safeco Field. I'm not sure if that's more than 2 miles away, but for us it definitely wasn't walking distance. That was very convenient. The restaurant I'm sure is overpriced, however, they had happy hour specials that we took advantage of each of the two nights we stayed there. I think it was $3 draft beers (large glasses and lots of variety and loca lmicrobrews), and buy two tapas selections and get the 3rd for free. They also had $1 off all well drinks. The tapas were reasonably priced and pretty filling, i was very surprised. They were also pretty creative, very tasty. The bed was far from luxurious. Actually, i didn't sleep under the covers just because of how the bedding looked. The blanket under the bed spread was ripped and looked as thought it had been there since the hotel was built and the sheets were all wrinkled. Not the best end to a honeymoon and not very romantic. They also did not vacuum the room when housekeeping came (we had to wait outside at 4:30pm for housekeeping to finish, so good thing the bar had those happy hour specials). We're not slobs, but we did leave some crumbs on the dark flooring from some chips that were still there and stepped on when we got back to our room. The only thing I would really want is a microwave in the room, we only had a small refrigerator. Overall, not a bad place, I would stay there again if I got another deal on hotwire, but definitely not a romantic stay for a honeymoon.",3
221,221,"Great Hotel for the price We stayed here for three nights before a cruise. We were on the tenth floor with a beautiful view of the Space needle. Rooms were very comfortable. Plenty of room for our family of four. We loved the location, since the hotel is situated centrally to everything we wanted to see. Staff was pleasant and helpful with any questions we had. If you don't mind walking, you can get to just about anywhere from this hotel. We will definitely stay here again when we come back to Seattle!!",5
222,222,"location Great place to stay if you're looking to be in the heart of the downtown festivities. We had a room with a view of the space needle (very cool). We walked from the hotel to Pike's market and to the shopping district. Both are just blocks away. Ralph's Grocery  Deli across the street is very convenient (and they sell Lambic). We went to a Marines game on Sunday. It wasn't too bad driving to the stadium and parking (15 bucks to park). Overall, the Warwick is a nice place (bathrooms are kinda small). We would stay there again, but also look at the abundant other hotels nearby just for some variety.",4
223,223,"Gem This hotel was an absolute gem. Small, but great service. The room was not huge but certainly adequate, clean and comfortable. Ask for a room on a high floor and get a great view of either downtown or the Space Needle.Best of all was the attentive staff. Concierges were friendly and helpful. The shuttle drivers also went out of their way (literally) for us. They will take you to the Victoria ferry and pick you up as well. Very convenient.Would recommend to anyone!",5
224,224,"A pretty good value I visit Seattle frequently. Sometimes for 1 or 2 days, sometimes for longer. If you are staying for only up to 2 nights, it is not worth it, especially after this hotel raised its rates lately. For you, I would recommend the Ramada a few steps away. But, if you are staying for a longer time, this is perfect. Especially with families. There are some fancier hotels in town but the Warwick would satisfy most families, especially the more expensive suites! The swimming pool is a bit dark and the balconies are acually just big step out windows, but there are views and the location is perfect. As for the small restaurant, dont go there, it is overpriced and does not have much to offer, there is much better food in Downtown.",4
225,225,"Good Alternative We stayed 4 nights in a room with a view of the space needle. This hotel is a few blocks from downtown shopping and on the edge of Belltown and a short walk to Pike Place Market. It's about 200 rooms--could be considered a large boutique hotel. Our room was not plush--but newish, clean with nice toiletries and bath robes. The service was fine and everyone who worked there was nice. In sum, the hotel is a bit of a compromise. Not the largest, not the most central, not the fanciest--but a convenient, well maintained place for the money.",4
226,226,"Comfortable and very convenient. We like the Warwick because of the great location - an easy walk to Pike Place Market, the Science Center, and downtown. Many good restaurants close by, and the incomparable Ralph's Deli right across the street (whose wireless signal works fine - you don't need to pay $9 for the hotel service). Ask for a room on the west side. The weekend escape rate at $179 is good value: it includes parking (otherwise $21) and breakfast (a $20 value).",4
227,227,"Good Hotel...Needs some improvement Stayed for 3 days in March. Great location...clean...reasonable rates...very friendly staff. Easy walk to to many attractions...Ralph's Market across the street is excellent.Some negatives though. Noisy heater fan in room...seems like a lot of rooms have this problem. PPV movie channel had terrible picture. Lots of interference on screen. Staff alerted but couldn't fix it. Pool is small but OK. 3 out of 4 aerobic machines in fitness centre broken!A Space Needle view will have you facing Lenora St. This is a very busy bus route so be prepared for lots of street noise. In my experience, any downtown hotel has lots of street noise so bring ear plugs if you're a light sleeper.",4
228,228,"Good hotel, lost a star because of the noisy heater and non-working pool The hotel location was perfect, right in the center of town and just a few blocks to the convention center. I walked from here to Pike's Place market for breakfast, then on to the convention center each day of the convention and found it all very convenient. (Try the Crumpet Shop for breakfast, delicious crumpets, and cheap lattes before 8:30am every day!) The hotel room was clean and everyone who worked here was helpful and perfectly friendly. The bed was too comfortable :). The first night I had trouble sleeping though, because the heater would wake me up every couple of hours. By the second night, I learned to tune it out. There is a coffee maker in the room, by the way (I had read somewhere that there was only coffee in the lobby, and this is not true.) There is also a nice little fridge where I stored away spring water for my week. I had a view of the Space Needle without even asking - very nice.Unfortunately, they were working on the pool during my one-week stay, and that was kind of annoying because I had chosen the hotel for their pool. I did get to swim the first night, and it was a nice smallish pool. There was a lukewarm hot tub attached. All in all, though, nice amenities. Would stay again, would recommend for the rates, the location and the comfy rooms.",4
229,229,Average American hotel,3
230,230,"Nice Small Hotel, Excellent Value We made online reservations for two nights on the hotel's website and took advantage of the Warwick Escapes package. The package included best available room upon arrival, parking and breakfast for two for $150 including all fees and taxes - what a bargain! On arrival we were greeted by pleasant and attentive parking attendants, bellmen and front desk staff. Our room was exactly what we requested - clean, no smoking, high floor, king bed, quiet room, away from elevator, view of the Space Needle. The hotel is centrally located and within walking distance of many major attractions, shops and restaurants. We truly enjoyed our stay at the Warwick and will, with no hesitation, recommend this hotel to friends and family.",4
231,231,"Above Average, Very Nice Stay The hotel is in an amazing location with great restaurants, gourmet grocery, and cinerama within 1 block radius. It has Macy's, Nordstroms, other shopping within a few blocks after that. The mattress was very comfy. AMAZING SWEEPING VIEW of space needle, lake union, downtown, and Elliott Bay. Great pool and gym facility too! Room service is nothing to write home about. Don't get the pizza. Parking was $21. YIKES! Old building, but nicely remodeled.",4

233,233,"A Night at the Warwick The rooms at the Warwick were nice. They were clean, comfortable and quiet. However, there was nothing exceptional about them. The restaurant was also nice and the food was good. The staff, on the other hand, was not pleasant or helpful. In fact there was one member of the staff who was outright rude. I felt like I was in their way when checking in and asking questions. I would recommend the Warwick to someone looking for a reasonable priced hotel, but don鈥檛 expect too much.",3
234,234,"The Night from Hell! After a late (midnight) arrival, the night manager argued to convince me that one bed and a pull-out sofabed constituted a room with two beds, forcing me to sleep in the same bed as my teenage son. The noisy heater cycled on and off all night, and the fan could not be set to stay on without heating. (Verified with the maintenance man.) Then the traffic started at 6am. By 6:30am I was in the lobby begging to switch to a different room. The same manager agreed there was a problem, but insisted he would have to charge me for the second room. Final straw: My son returned to the room at 2pm, not knowing I had checked out at noon. HIS KEY STILL WORKED, even though someone else had checked in. Not knowing this, my son went through someone else's shopping bags, until he realized they weren't ours. The Warwick Seattle hotel has major problems: noisy intermittent heating, lots of street noise with little insulation, and bad security. But the worst problem was the night manager, Chuck, who refused to help.",1
235,235,"Great Stay We stayed at the Warwick for one night (was supposed to be two but the train ran 10 hours late!). The front desk staff were fantastic - we arrived in the morning after missing our first night due to the Amtrak train running late and we were fully expecting to be charged for the night we missed - but they waived that nights charges, something they didnt have to do. The rooms were nice and clean, we had a fantastic view of the Space Needle. We were using this hotel as a temporary stop over before going to the Inn at El Gaucho (see review) and when we were leaving the Warwick provided a shuttle to El Gaucho - fantastic service. Felt a little guilty leaving as we had no complaints at all with the Warwick and could have happily stayed there.From our experiences at the Warwick I would happily recommend the hotel.",4
236,236,"Nice Hotel and Service, but . . . . My husband and I decided to plan a trip with my cousin and her husband. They had stayed at the Warwick many years ago and loves the space needle view. So, we booked both of our rooms at the Warwick for a three night stay. Upon arrival, my cousin told me, don't expect a huge lobby or check in counter. Boy was she right!! The lobby area is very small but cozy. Check in/out, question desk and concierge are all at one desk that is about 15 feet long. You feel so cramped if you are getting information and there are two people waiting behind you!! But, very good service. The manager who checked us in gave us coupon books, maps, anything that was going to help us around the city. That was very nice!The room was clean and looked nice. Until we went into the restroom. It was clean, very small, but clean but looked like a fist was coming through the ceiling. It was very weird! Also, in the shower, there was a cover that looked as if it was ready to fall off. We paid for the upgaded view of the space needle. We were told we'd be able to see it from our bed. Well, that was false. In order to see the needle, you had to stand in the corner and look at it or open the slider to see it. It was ok though. We read some reviews about the pool being kind of dingy and dark, but nice once you were in the water. So we tried it out. It is in the basement, but the elevator takes you right there. The first thing you notice when you walk in is the stench of chlorine. It smelled so bad. We decided to muddle through and went in the pool. The temp was nice, but we then opted for the spa. From the steam and the chlorine, both my husband and I had to leave because our eyes were burning and watering so bad. We told the front desk and a lady responded with how do you expect us to keep it clean? Overall, it was nice, but we probably won't stay there again. We found a hotel a few blocks closer to all of the shopping that was way nicer and cleaner and had cheaper rates. I think we will give it a try next time.",3
237,237,"The Right small hotel I travel for business and prefer relatively small hotels instead of the huge, name-brand dormatories. In Seattle, I found the Warwick. Two hundred rooms, not 2000. A very personable staff. Free shutle rides to your appointments around downtown. Tiny excertise room, pool, adequate restaurant, 24 hour room service. All at rates lower than the more famous people barns down the street. A very pleasant experience.PS. The hotel is in the upgrade process and the refurbished rooms come at at a $20 premium. Worth it.",4
238,238,"OK hotel; good location; watch out for construction noise We just returned from a 3-night stay at the Hotel Warwick. I agree with previous posters that the staff is nice and the location very convenient. The hotel is an easy walk to downtown shopping areas and Seattle Center attractions. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, but there were a few problems worth mentioning.We chose this hotel in part because the rooms feature an outside balcony. My husband smokes, but I do not, and we prefer to get a smoking room with windows or an outside balcony to minimize smoke inside the room. If this is your preference, be advised that the balconies are barely wide enough to fit a human. We did not feel safe actually standing on the balcony, especially with the balcony door closed. Smokers beware: the hotel only has a few smoking rooms, all located on the second floor. This floor is where the public meeting rooms and restrooms for the restaurant and bar are located. We requested a smoking room on an upper floor with a Space Needle view. We were given a smoking room on the 2nd floor. No Space Needle, no view. This was obviously not one of the renovated rooms. The ceiling light fixtures were about a dozen 1970s-era cans (track lighting) set in rows in the ceiling, directed at the bed. It felt like starring in your very own intimate film. The bathroom also had a paper towel dispenser like in a public restroom and strange pink goo in the soap dispenser, which looked like it hadn't been changed since the track lighting was installed. The traffic noise was incredibly loud, and hotel construction noise started very early. Due to a very late flight, the desk was unable to change our room on check-in, but told us to come back the next day. We changed to a nonsmoking 7th floor room the next day, which thankfully was more updated. The traffic noise was a little better a few floors up, and we had a nice Space Needle view. The bed was comfortable, the amenities average. We liked the in-room refrigerator. There was intermittent construction noise throughout the hotel. Hotel renovations are ongoing; the noise wasn't too bad on the weekend, but I would take care if staying during the week. Also, the smoke detector in our room was not operational (the device was unhooked and sitting on top of the closet). I called maintenance to have it hooked up, but it didn't get done during our stay.We did not use the pool or jacuzzi. As a previous poster noted, the spa facilities are in the basement, and it felt too isolated for my comfort. However, we liked the bar quite a bit. Friendly staff, good drinks and draft beer selection and a nice atmosphere. We ate at the bar one night, primarily for convenience. There are certainly better places to eat in Seattle, but the food was OK and we had a nice time. The concierge was very helpful in helping us select a restaurant that was perfect for our tastes and making dinner reservations. The lobby fireplace added a cheerful, cozy ambience and we enjoyed warming up there after our sightseeing. I will probably want to check out a different hotel the next time I am in Seattle. However, if you avoid the second floor rooms and don't mind a little construction noise, the Hotel Warwick is a convenient, friendly and generally comfortable place to stay.",3
239,239,"doesn't honor reservation's price Made a reservation using the 50% Entertainment book discount (mentioned at time of reservation) and when we went to check in, they said they haven't honored that for weeks. So we cancelled the room before we found out that there was a huge convention in town that took over all the hotels in the area, and we had to cut our vacation short. The Warwick apparently thinks a few bucks (from milking conventioneers) is worth ticking off a few Entertainment book users. Definitely not 3 star material to me...pretty sleazy IMHO.",1
240,240,Best place to stay in Downtown Seattle A great place to stay in downtown Seattle. We were able to walk everywhere. Our room was nicely furnished and clean. The entire staff was friendly and helpful. The Ralphs grocery and deli across the street is a real plus. We are definetly staying here next Seattle trip.,5
241,241,"Nice Hotel We stayed at the Warwick pre cruise. Chosen for location, price and free area shuttle. The shuttle was great to get us to the ship on Sunday morning. The Warwick is within easy walking distance to just about everything, but we had luggage so the shuttle was great. Desk staff and concierge are friendly and helpful. We did not eat at the restaurant, but spent time watching football in the bar area after checking out/ pre-cruise and the bartender was great!Room was a bit small, but clean and comfortable.Only complaint was street noise (people yelling, not traffic) at all hours all night. We were on a lower floor. I think if you're higher it would be ok.Despite that, we would definately stay here again.",4
242,242,Great Location and friendly staff!       The restaurant at night,4
243,243,"Classy downrown location An older hotel, the Warwick nevertheless has been renovated and retained a sort of 1970's charm. the room was spacious and the view of the Space Needle terrific. However, they charge way too much for Internet Access - ESPECIALLY since you can get FREE Wi-Fi in the grocer-deli on the corner, and it is open to 1AM. Staff was courteous and helpful, and the restaurant is quite good. Everything is in walking distance. Great place to stay when in Seattle!",4
244,244,"My travel needs were well met I was traveling alone and felt welcomed and safe with the small lobby and friendly desk staff; the room was comfortable, with good beds, small step-out balcony (and windows that open!), bathrobe, very clean, missed having an armchair to read in; loved the fruitplate and individual coffee pots in the dining room, where service was prompt and friendly; gourmet market across the street has all kinds of goodies and other supplies, and there are plenty of restaurants and stores within easy walking distance. The indoor pool is small and lightly used, but clean and pleasant.",4
245,245,Home away from home Just spent three nights at this most conveniently located property. As a flight attendant I stay in many big name brand properties so have a good idea of what's good or bad. The Warwick looks to have been renovated and yes some of the rooms are in places worn however they are comfortable and clean. The major thing we noticed here was the staff. Everyone from front desk clerk to housekeeping was just fantastic. They could have not been more helpful and really made Seattle a pleasure to visit. The hotel has a free shuttle which runs anywhere you want to go within about 2 miles. The drivers are well versed in geography and no journey seemed like too much trouble. It's not a Hilton or a brand hotel BUT it does have genuine personality and a caring team behind the product. It's not fake or pretentious. Great location and safe area at night. You have great shops and restaurants within walking distance - try Lolas just next door for flawless food.,5
246,246,"Bad Choice! I booked this hotel through Hot Wire and called immediately requesting a nonsmoking room, a king bed and a room away from the elevator/ice.The person I spoke to was pleasant and stated they could not guarantee these requests would be honored but would make a note on the reservation. At check-in, the person at the desk was very rude, said there were no special request noted on our reservation card andstated there were no king beds and because of the way the reservation was made we were stuck with 2 double beds. We were located directly accross from the elevator and ice! It was nonsmoking. There is no elevator from the parking garage to the hotel. The Warwick mats in the garage are filthy as are the stairwells. The part of the hotel that faces 4th smells of urine. The carpets in the registration and elevator area need cleaning. The upholstery and curtains in our room needed cleaning andpressing There was a sign in the bathroom about water conservation;however, the tub facet dripped continuously. The tub drain needsattention, the shower curtain has holes in it. There was no coffee maker in the room. The bedding did not fit the bed and we found ourselves sleeping directly on the mattress with bedding askew. Other staff were also unfriendly and short. The housekeeping staff was quite pleasant. I will NEVER stay at this hotel!",1
247,247,"Wonderful, wonderful service! Beautiful View The concierge and all the front desk staff completely blew us away with their attentiveness and desire to make our trip great. They make you feel welcome! Their knowledge of the city is fantastic as well.The room we were in was a smoking room, but we couldn't really tell, there wasn't much of a lingering smell of cigarettes. The balcony windows open wide to the wonderful view of the space needle. The restaurant was lovely, we felt insecure not being very dressed up but they didn't seem to mind at all and treated us like guests. We will be back! Stay at the Warwick!",5
248,248,"Fun for the movies I stayed here with my boyfriend the night that Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Opened. The hotel is right across the street from the Cinerama (Seattle's best big screen theatre). The hotel was completely full, I think mostly with StarWars people. So I think the staff was a little overwhelmed. Most everyone was nice but we were yelled at when we were checked out (20 min late on an already late check out). That made me a little bit mad but I'll take it with a grain of salt that it was a one time occurence.The balcony is the best part of the room, it's so wonderful to be up really high and to be able to get fresh air (I hate hotels where you can't open the windows). Great view of the Space Needle. I just loved the balcony!Bathroom is incredibly small but was very clean and had pretty marble fixtures, I think they do have suites with large tubs if that is what you're after.Bed was comfortable, tv was good, minibar was nice and not ridiculously overpriced.Pool was small but fine, seemed slightly deeper than most Seattle hotel pools but I was operating on very little sleep so maybe I'm remembering it wrong. Hot tub was quite pleasant and not too hot, just hot enough.It's a good location, close to lots of restaurants and across the street from a fancy little grocery store that also serves food (tasty stuff).We had roomservice, I wasn't overly impressed but it wasn't bad, we ordered two cheeseburgeres, a caesar salad and clam chowder. I'm probably just annoyed that my cheeseburger was too well done and it was too late at night to send it back, my boyfriend enjoyed his. I did like the chowder and the bread that I requested with it was good (Rosemary bread from the Essential Bakery).I would definitely stay here again if I was attending a movie event or if I needed to be in that neighborhood.",4
249,249,"Great Hotel and Location Hotel was very clean, comfortable and nicely appointed. The location was great-pretty much in the middle of the shopping area, pikes' market and the space needle. Close to good bars and resturants. Highly recommend.",5
250,250,"very nice hotel and staff My wife and I stayed at the hotel for just one night, april 24th 2005. I wish we would have had time to stay here for several nights. The hotel was very clean. Our room had a spectacular view of the Space Needle. The staff was very helpful with questions. The breakfast in the in-hotel restaurant was very good. I definitely recommend this hotel for vacationing couples.",5
251,251,"Great Location and Value We were here for the Easter long weekend and loved it. We received a very fair rate and the staff at the front desk were very helpful and they even had a free shuttle to downtown which we only used on our first night becuase we soon realised just how close we really were to everything. we were about a 25 minutte walk to Pioneer Square about 15 minute walk to Pike Place Mareket and a 20 minute walk to Space Needle / EMP. The rooms are clean and well kept with a mini fridge in the room that I really like, but sadly no coffee maker. My only major beef was the $21 for nightly parking which was a blatant rip-off considering they only charge $8 to park all-day.",5
252,252,"Sisters from Coeur d' Alene, Idaho My sister and I stayed at the Warwick from 3 nights on spring break. We loved the hotel!! The location was amazing becuase we could walk anywere and the 24 hour shuttle was great!! We ordered room service for breakfast which took longer then I would have liked but when it arrived he told us they were really busy and he works in the restaurant so he just ran it up instead of just waiting so he got a good tip. When we arrived the valet was great and they took our lougage up to our room for us. All in all it was a great stay and I will be staying here again. Be aware of some of the bad reviews because some of those people sound a little high maintnance.",4
253,253,"Good value hotel We have stayed at the Warwick several times over the past few years, and I spent the night there on March 25, 2005. The room was fine, with King bed, TV with pay per view movies, and a mini-fridge. Only thing missing was a coffee maker. Nice marble bathroom with hand held shower. The view on the east side of the hotel is the Space Needle, while this time I viewed the 2 Westin hotel towers. The price was right, and I got 10 miles per $ with my AAdvantage card! Only fly in the ointment was the $21 overnight parking charge. I would definately come back, as the location is great.",4
254,254,"Warwick Bad I see good reviews of the Warwick and it shocks me...The staff was quite rude, the rooms were fairly dirty. I cut myself and asked for a bandaid and they did not have any?!?! I requested a bottle opener and they also did not have that... Go somewhere with better service.",2
255,255,"A Decent Experience at the Warwick My husband and I stayed at the Warwick after a company party. I had made our reservations well in advance in order to secure a special group rate for our company's partygoers. The reservations agent that I spoke with was pleasant, thorough, and helpful - he made sure that I understood what I would need to know about my reservation.Our first discrepancy occurred upon arrival. I had researched, at the Warwick's own website, the cost of overnight parking - it stated that it was $21.00 effective March 1, 2005. When we arrived, however, the parking attendant informed us that it was $18.00 and that we could add it to our bill. Upon check-in, this information changed again and we were instead informed that parking was indeed $21.00. Honestly, I believe that both amounts are ridiculously overpriced, especially considering that other hotel guests paid much more for their reservations and still had to pay this outrageous parking fee. Regardless, I disregarded the discrepancy and signed my bill. I wasn't going to cause a stink over $3.00.The bill was the second discrepancy of the afternoon - our company was given a group rate of $79.00 per night, however, my check-in information stated that it was $75.00. I shrugged this off as well, figuring that it made up for the miscommunication with regards to the cost of parking.The room itself was lovely. We were pleased with its setup and cleanliness and I really admired the furniture. While a fan in the bathroom would have been nice, it was easily overlooked once we opened the curtains and looked out onto the city - what a great view!Upon check-out the next morning, we again met with inconsistencies. Our bill was slid under the door of our room prior to our departure, so I reviewed it for accuracy. Suddenly the room rate was $79.00 again! While this was the rate that I had expected to pay, I was a little annoyed with the constant miscommunication. Not only that, but there were others from my company staying at the Warwick also - they had also mentioned checking in at a rate of $75.00.When my husband and I arrived at the front desk to check out (for some reason, video checkout would not work for our room), I mentioned these discrepancies to the front desk clerk. I made it clear, or so I thought, that I wasn't worried about the small amount of money that these miscommunications involved ($7.00, all told), but that I wanted someone to know what had happened. I wasn't even able to get out that I knew others that had been advised $75.00 at check-in that may be, well, more vocal than I was being.The desk clerk seemed clearly put out by this information and gave me short, quick answers to my questions. He informed me that the garage attendents were still having trouble remembering that their rate had changed and that the company party rate was $79.00. I explained to him again that I was okay with paying $79.00, but wanted him to realize that the paperwork provided at check-in stated $75.00. Honestly, he huffed and puffed and then took $4.00 off my bill. Really? I didn't care about the money. I just wanted him, or anyone, to know that people were being misinformed. My husband, who is quick to tell me when I'm getting overbearing and pushy (aren't all husbands good for that?), agreed that I had not done anything of the sort when speaking with the desk clerk.Overall, I can't give this hotel more than 3 stars. The hotel itself is beautiful and centrally located, but the service and attention we received was far from expectation.",3
256,256,"Space Needle View We stayed at the Warwick for three nights about two years ago and loved it. We had traveled by Amtrak from Sacramento and then took the Clipper to Victoria for a couple of days. It was a magical vacation...all public transportation and walking to our destinations. Our room had one whole wall of windows that faced the Space Needle. (There was a sliding door that opened onto the balcony...weird) The room was small, but so cozy. The staff was wonderful. They have 24 hour shuttle service and we enjoyed talking with the drivers. We had dinner one night and it was great, the waitress had a strong French accent (something we don't hear often in CA) Beautiful food presentation,We easily walked to the Market. The Mall was great, with Monorail stop so convenient. Street entertainers were wonderful,and we were delighted to find real stores open on Sunday. We bought bento (box) lunches at the sandwich shop near the hotel and took them on the train,It was the best vacation ever..so glad that my daughter told us to stay at the Warwick. later I remembered that I had stayed at a Warwick hotel in Denver and enjoyed that too.",5
257,257,"Will be back..... Stayed the weekend of January 28th at the Warwick Hotel.Booked the day before and was told all I could get was a smoking King size on the city side.I told them that my preference would be a king size non-smoking on the Space Needle side away from the elevators as I had read here.When we arrived we discovered that our room was as requested.We were greeted by the concierge who was very helpful.The room was average size and the bed was comfortable.The wife loved the tub and the marble tiles in the bathroom.The room was very clean.We had a package that they advertised on their website which was $150 per night tax included , parking, and breakfast in the restaurant (which was very good).All hotels in Seattle charge anywhere from 15-25 dollars a night for parking.The location is great we walked to the Pike Place Market ,the Harbour front,the convention centre area at night for dinner.There were lots of people walking about and we had no safety concerns.Ralph's grocery market /Deli is next door and open till 2AM for food or snacks.",5
258,258,"Good location, Nice View The room was nice, Location was good, View was wonderful....Top floor (19th) Corner suite Room 1901 the balcony they advertise you can barely stand sideways on. The staff were great. The only complaint was the bathroom.... dirty Q-tip on counter when we arrived and dirty towel on floor by garbage can! How can a Housekeeper miss this? Hair in the tub. Room could use some upgrading looking a little worn.",4
259,259,"Great service in the Warwick We just recently spent 4 days during our Christmas holidays at the Warwick. The sincere helpfulness, care and courtesy which we experienced from everyone at the front desk, restaurant, room service and housekeeping staff was truly above average and greatly appreciated. The restaurant turned out fabulous meals even during a time when I'm certain that they were operating with a skeleton staff. The only thing that prevents me from giving this place an excellent rating is the following: The hotel is tired. Old dirty carpets and bedding that you'd expect to find in a hostel. Given the price range of rooms - a serious face lift is necessary.",4
260,260,"Great stay We recently had a wonderful overnight at the Warwick. It was an easy walk to Seattle Art Museum and even closer to downtown shopping. The front desk was extremely gracious at check in, offering shopping discount coupons and restaurant reservations. We enjoyed breakfast at the hotel and the morning free coffee in the lobby. The waitstaff in both the bar and hotel were attentive. Our room on the 15th floor had a city/water view. While there are hotels closer in downtown, we would have no problem choosing the Warwick again.",4
261,261,"Pleasant stay My wife and I stayed here on the final leg of our honeymoon in September after a 1700 mile drive from Vegas. We found the hotel no problem, the location is great and although the hotel looks somewhat shabby from the outside it's really quite elegant inside.What made our stay here particularly nice was the fact that we were given a room with a view of the space needle. The floor-to-ceiling window opened fully and we were able to enjoy the view with the sea air too! At night the view was spectacular.Staff were friendly and helpful, the cocktail bar is great and we enjoyed our stay here. Two quibbles: 1. The price - this is not a cheap hotel and with state tax and room occupancy tax it was one of the more pricey hotels we stayed at. If you're not on a budget it's worth it. 2. The lobby area is small and at the weekend was extremely busy with lots of people standing around seemingly at a loss.",4
262,262,"could have been better..... Well for those who read trip advisor reviews, I hope you will pay close attention to this one. We stayed recently at the Warwick Seattle, for a few nights before continuing our Pacific Northwest journey to British Columbia. We booked through Clipper Vacations, the price was right, and we were told we would really like this hotel. From the moment we walked in there was a definite charm to it; cozy older lobby with a fireplace, 4 clocks from different major cities (I like this feature) and a concierge desk. At the front desk we were greated by a very cold and young front desk agent . No formal greeting no nothing, but a straight and matronly face (we were surprised as she must have been under 20). We asked her not to put us near the elevator in a room number ending in a 6. (We read this on trip advisor). She put us in roon number ending in 8. We went up to the room and this room was right next to the elevator. I immediately marched back down, and asked her to switch the room. (she did without any apology) She moved us 4 doors down. We were in the room for an hour or 2. We noticed it was very cold in the room, and we tried to adjust the heat, it did not work. We called and immediately they came up to try to fix. It was redeemed broken. So we then moved to another 4 flights up. We were in this room 10 minutes, and they called to say they wanted to move us again as there was going to be alot of kids coming in for a wedding and they would be on this floor, so then we moved to another floor ( 4 different rooms). We asked if they could upgrade us to a larger room , they said no because we were on a package rate. I thought this was wrong as were inconvenienced. I was too tired to argue at this point. THE ROOM: the really need to redo standard rooms. The carpet is a checked brown and white, reminded me of an old holiday inn. The lights are very very dim, I guess to save money. The hotel is not in the greatest area and beware of seedy people around there. Brasserie Margaux was terrific and the grocery street across the street (ralph's) is great. I do not think I would stay at the Warwick again.",2
263,263,An excellent stay !!! We stayed here 27th Sep-30th Sep and had a fantastic stay. The hotel is within walking distance to the Space Needle or the waterfront and is ideally located. We had a room on the 12th floor with a fantastic view of the Space Needle. It was very comfortable and well maintained. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and couldnt do enough for you. A wonderful start to our holiday in the States !!!,5

289,289,"Great Location, but don't stay long We needed a place to stay in Seattle prior to catching an early morning Amtrak train to Portland. We looked around the train station but there is not much there. We were dropping our Hertz car off at the Hilton downtown and just wanted a place to spend the night. I called the Hotel Seattle based on it's location on tourist map near the Hilton. I didn't have access to internet to research any reviews, so did not see any until after our stay. The location is great, virtually next door to the high end hotels. It was half the price of the Hilton so we thought we would give it a try. When we checked in, I asked about a AAA discount, but the clerk's response was What's that?. That was the first time I ever heard of a hotel desk clerk (in US) not knowing what AAA was. Our room could have been used for a low budget movie's version of a run down hotel, threadbare carpets, dingy curtains not quite hanging right, minimal lighting (a strange hanging light in the middle of the room), dingy bathroom. Although it was definitely dingy, it did not appear obviously dirty. No a/c but luckily we didn't need it. The bed was not particularly comfortable, a little on the boucy side and with two people you both definitely gravitated to the middle. There was no clock in the room, but we did get the wake up call we requested.It was ok for spending the one night, I wouldn't want to spend more. On the positive side, it was a great safe location, quick taxi ride to train station, and the shower was great. They have not invested in low flow shower heads so the water pressure was really high. We also really enjoyed the conversation with the desk clerk the next morning. When I mentioned the clerk the previous night had never heard of AAA, he told us that clerk was a moron and that the owner must not have asked him anything but his name in the interview. He went on to say that we should check out the reviews on Trip Advisor, they were listed as one of the worst hotels in Seattle! You gotta love that type of enthusiastic employee! All in all, it worked for us for one night. But our friend the day clerk did mention that we had one of the nicer rooms! (I definitely don't want to see the not so nice ones!) Recommend you ask to see room before committing.",2
290,290,"Great location. Horrible room  Hotel Seattle is right in the heart of downtown, and is perfect walking distance to anything. The room we stayed in was abominable. It smelled like a thrift store, the pillows and blankets were minute, the bathroom belonged to a truck stop. The tile in the floor was cracked, the vent sounded like a wind tunnel, there was mold in every crease and there was no liner to rank-smelling shower curtain. The staff was unfriendly. The cleaning staff's cart was parked infront of our room's door when we first arrived. The maid watched impassively as we put down our luggage and stuggled to move her cart without offering any assistance as we moved it aside to get into our room.It was a bed for the night near to Seattle's attractions, but that was it.",1
291,291,"You get what you pay for I had read the reviews before I booked and knew what I was getting into. With that in mind, I wasn't surprised. In fact it was better than we expected. Yes, the rooms are outdated, the towels and floormat were thin, limited cable TV and an overall lack of amenities that one is use to in a US hotel. But as one reviewer said it is like a budget overseas hotel and I have stayed in several that were in similar condition and I just enjoyed the experience.  The check in and desk service was great. We asked for extra pillows from the maid and got them. We also spent $5 for flowers at Pike Street and they added character to the room.Location is everything. Our friends stayed at the Fairmont across the street and we stayed for 3 nights what one night cost them. My money went to dinners, trip to Victoria and baseball games.",3

295,295,"It's a dump! Hotel Seattle is a seedy, overpriced dump. My wife and I spent three nights there in August 2008. The only real amenity was a color television. The bathroom exhaust vent was so loud we could barely hear the television when the bathroom door was open. The carpet was worn bare. The room had no air-conditioner. Although the first two nights there were pleasant with the windows open for a breeze in the room, the last night was extremely hot and uncomfortable due to a heat wave in Seattle. The hotel had no small fans available for use in our room. In addition, the hotel provided no ice. In fact, the front desk clerk told us we could have all the ice we wanted if we went down the street and bought it at a local convenience store. No hairdryer was provided either. Overall, our experience at this hotel was much less than desirable, especially since the room rate was higher than we usually pay for the usual amenities, i.e., air-conditioning, hair dryer, ice machine, mirror near beds, etc.",1
296,296,"Complete Dump While tempting because of a nice, central location and price, unless you don't mind a hotel that has had no updating in over 30 years, including the disgusting orange 70's (used to be shag) carpet in the rooms - stay away!They did a fair job of keeping it clean, they only have so much to work with when the ownership obviously could care less about investing one penny in the property.The room smelled of things not to mention.If you keep the lights off, don't look in the corners, and wear your shoes while in your room at all times, you might be OK.No network available, so impossible for a business traveler. TV doesn't really work.",1
297,297,"This Hotel Fit our Bill We stayed in Hotel Seattle for 2 nights and it was fine. It reminded me of the funky less expensive hotel rooms I found in Europe. There was some street parking available (the desk clerk pointed that out to us) during the week (don't know about how crowded it can be on the weekends). And there is a garage right up the street if there isn't any street parking.We were in Seattle for a wedding and wanted an inexpensive hotel downtown that was close to Pike Market, restaurants and other attractions and this fit the bill. The front desk staff was very very friendly helping us find restaurants and directions back to the airport. If you just want a place to sleep (because you'll mostly be out touristing, if you aren't looking for luxury, don't care about matching furniture, or city noises, this hotel is perfect. The beds were clean and comfy and I really liked the pillows. The room was cleaned both days and fresh towels delivered. I read all the previous reviews and was concerned but decided it would be an adventure and if nothing else we would have a good story. But after staying there I realized that expectations really vary amongst guests. We felt safe, slept well, had nice staff encounters. If you want luxury, and newer accommodations, then by all means stay at the mocking W hotel. But if you were reamed liked we were on the airfare and don't have the money, stay here. Its funky, old, centrally located and has a nice staff.ps. The photographer who shot the lovely photo of the room did and amazing job, and possibly knows a lot about photoshop. Our room paled by comparison. But that's OK",3
298,298,"Beware My family and I were traveling to Seattle for the graduation of our niece. This was a special time for us. A member of the family looked on the web for a hotel close to the graduation facility. All looked well on the internet for moderate priced accomodations for three nights. We called them directly and booked the stay. The staff was very nice and none of this review is meant to reflect on the them in any way. We understood that this was a moderate priced placed to stay but did not expect the what we found.The rooms are dark and dank and look like something that comes out of film noir. The bathroom had paper rolling off of the walls; it took two to three flushes for the toilet to flush. it was the most depressing place I have ever stayed in. We knew immediately upon arrival in the room that we could not stay there for 3 nights, so we took steps to find other acommodations and were fortunate to find them. We had to stay one night and I spent that entire time awake. We were at the nearest coffee shop at 5:30 a.m. and left in a taxi by 8:30 a.m.I write this review out of concern for others who plan to stay there. It was not a pleasant experience. Beware.",1
299,299,"Last Resort Faced with a completely sold out Seattle on a recent trip, I booked one night at The Hotel Seattle as a last resort. You should do the same, though you may first want to consider the more pleasant surroundings of a bus station. This is a truly awful, depressing hotel. I imagine most of the stains in the 30-year old carpet are the remnants of past guests who, when faced with the prospect of spending a night in this hotel, took their own lives. I myself managed to survive, wisely spending very little time in my room, which was on a high floor, overlooking a proud, mocking W Hotel. I stayed out as late as possible and checked out by 5:00 am, my escape somewhat delayed by a desk clerk who was having trouble lining up the little holes in the paper of a relic of a dot matrix printer.",1
300,300,Reccommended - Great location and price! After struggling to find a hotel with rooms free at a very busy time of year we eventually found the Hotel Seattle. It is in a great location and half the price of most other hotels in the area. The room was clean although the decor was slightly old-fashioned. Staff were friendly and helpful trying to help out with information about the local area at various times of the day and night. If you just want somewhere to sleep and as a base to explore Seattle this hotel is perfect. If you want somehwere a bit more stylish that will charge you at least twice the price then Seattle has plenty of choice!!!,4
301,301,"No customer service the only good thing was location. the staff was rude, unhelpful, and didn't have knowledge of the area. the tub had black foot prints upon arrival, the towels were old and ratty with holes in them, and the room had a musty smell. the TV only got a clear picture half the time on one channel. the bathroom sink was movable and the toilet was very small, had exposed pipes. no AC so had to sleep with the windows open and downtown Seattle is extremely noisy at night. only one attendant in the entire hotel at night. would not stay here again!!!!!!!!!!!",1
302,302,"alright for the price and location       pic from hallway into the room, ancient tv, dark decor",2
303,303,"Only good thing was location... The only decent thing about this hotel is the location, which is excellent, I've stayed in better value hostels.The room was dirty, the ceiling plaster had a great chunk missing over the bed and the shower backing was falling off the wall The staff were just not interested. The decor dated from the 1970's and was all various shades of brown, grim and depressing Only stayed one night , then found somewhere else.",1
304,304,UHHHH place to stay This was a great place for a very low key weekend getaway in a great location. The room was a little dirty and they forgot to change our linens one day but it was in the perfect location and right across the street from the fairmont without the expense. I do not know if we will stay there again but it was ideal on a tight budget.,2
305,305,"Stay in a hostel You will have better accommodations. With a name like Hotel Seattle I expected that they would take more pride in their establishment. My room was falling apart. From the baseboard coming off, to the unfinished shower, and not to mention, the unfinished pipes leading into a cut out hole in the floor. In the height of summer there was no A.C. and the only way to get some cool air was to open the window onto the busy street. I will never recommend Hotel Seattle and made sure none of the guest at the wedding I attended will go there either.",1
306,306,"Dirty and run down Thankfully we only stayed one night at the Hotel Seattle. Our room was an absolute disgrace.....very tatty witha layer of dust on most furniture. The bathroom had to be seen to be believed. The bath was old with ingrained dirt, the sink wobbled and leaked at the base. The floor tiles had a few decades ago seen better days. The shower head was loose.............the list is endless. We payed$96 plus tax. For that amount I expected a basic clean room. I have stayed in many hotels over the years and I can truly say that this hotel ranks as the worst I have ever stayed in. Whilst the location is handy for many of the tourist sights, it is not the best area to wander around at night and we felt quite uneasy doing so.I wish I had consulted Trip Advisor before staying there. Stay away!",1
307,307,"Scary experience all around The staff was nice. That's about the only nice thing I can say about this place. The photos of the hotel are very misleading. Standing outside looking at the hotel, you have to wonder if the photo on their website has been doctored at all. The photos of the rooms were obviously taken at a different hotel because the room I was put in, and then moved to another looked NOTHING like the room photos on their website. As someone else said in a previous review about this hotel, don't walk around the room without your shoes and socks on. Definitely not a romantic getaway (unless you're trying to break up with someone.) The sheets had hair on them. I requested a non-smoking room, but you could tell that someone had smoked in it previously. There was no air condtioning or a fan. Big deal, it's Seattle, right? Wrong. It was 90 plus degrees during my stay. The windows do open though, providing little relief. Cable television? Non-existant. I was told that sometimes it comes in, and sometimes it doesn't. What does that mean, really? It's sad when you pay $96 a night and can't even get the local channels (NBC, ABC, CBS.) Go on the internet for your news? There is no internet, unless you want to setup your laptop for dialup. The restaurant downstairs was a dive. Again, the service was great, but as with the rooms, you could tell that management didn't quite care about upgrading anything. Several times during my meal, I could have swore I saw something scurrying across the floor. The waitress seemed embarrassed while attempting to relieve me of my worries. I forgot to mention the lobby. The sofa was very comfortable. In fact, it may have been the nicest thing in the entire hotel. However, don't lean your head back while on the sofa or you'll notice that there is paint peeling off the ceiling in large chunks held together by duct tape in places. Speaking of duct tape, there was actually duct tape holding the carpet together in several places. The room I stayed in had scotch tape holding the wallpaper over this gaping hole. Security risk? Room keys have the room number and hotel name on the key ring. So, don't bring anything valuable, because who knows how often the locks are changed and if previous customers have lost their keys on drinking binges in Pioneer Square. There is no room service. It looked like there was only one person there at all times. If you're hungry, don't eat the food in the vending machine. Both the pretzels and Twix candybar were past their expiration date. At check out, staff was apologetic for the things I told them, but obviously not at fault. While you could sense their understandable frustration through their body language (not quite making eye contact, embarrased look on their face), you got the feeling that they hear about similar guest experiences on a regular basis. It's a shame because it's in a great location. You almost wonder if management is even in it to make money. I never did hear back from them after I sent a letter detailing my disappointments. I highly recommend not staying here. Avoid at all costs.",1
308,308,"Great value and comfortable! What a relief! I blindly booked this by calling the hotel - they only had a suite - and got a great rate. Our room was clean (a few carpet stains in corners, no big deal), huge, smoke-free, had a kitchenette (microwave) and was in the middle of downtown.The staff was friendly and helpful, the restaurant attached was excellent for breakfast, comfortable enough beds, and the location was quiet at night. Our room was right next to the elevator, and even that was inaudible!Cons - parking can be a nightmare - its street or city parking garage only, which can be costly ($20/day); not much of a view; some of the floors look like they might not have been updated - ask for one that has (and a suite!); only one elevator for about 11 floors); not too generous on the extra amenities (towels, shampoo, pillows) - if you ask, you get what you need though.",4
309,309,"Budget traveler's delight Seattle Hotel is all about location. It is in a good area within a block of the Fairmont and Monte Carlo on Seneca Street. It is right beside a starbucks. The hotel is a 1930's hotel, which today makes it very run down and basic. The lobby is simple yet attractive. Check in service was quick and basic. The rooms had furniture that was chipping its finishing. TV was basic 6 channels and not all coming in clear. There was no radio.The beds were comfortable. The pillows were a bit clumpy.The bathroom tub was aged and had markings on it from its life use. The toilet was like one from a ferry with a push handle. The bathroom was small and basic. Although run down, it did not concern me. Shag carpet and wall paper dated from the 1930's.I had a comfortable sleep and was happy to be paying a budget price for a quick overnight stay.Its the perfect stop for a budget traveler and someone not expecting more from the decor.",3
310,310,"Trust me, dont come to this hotel, its a nightmare!! This hotel is realli aweful, is the worse one i had choose from. i stay here just because at that time all hotels are full. therefore i stayed one night at there. Its horrible. u cannot image the carpet is green colour and kinda bug bites. and the ceiling is broken, also, the TV is kinda 1950's one, they should UPGRADE a new one okay? i haven't seen this kinda of OLD TV, and only can watch one or two channels and the colour from that TV is worse. The telephone is realli old. The elevator is worse than ever. and the light whether outside and inside all deem, not dark...realli terrify me to stay at there, its kinda hunting house. the service is not quite good also.do you need to choose cheap hotel, nice and clean one, u should choose 6 Ave Inn, that quite good i stay there for two nights be4 this hotel seattle. realli a nightmare for me. DONT CHOOSE THIS ONE, THE PICTURE IS FAKE...HORRIBLE.",1
311,311,"Ok if you just need a place to sleep First off, I will say that this hotel is in a great location, 3 blocks to the pike place market, shopping etc. Second, of course this hotel is located on a hill...all of downtown seattle toward the water is. If you are elderly, you may have issues with this but for most people it will not be an issue. This hotel pretty much only has its location going for it. It is an old hotel, which is pretty rundown. It did have clean sheets, which is basically what we were looking for. Did I walk around barefoot on the carpet or bathroom floor, the answer is no. A little dirty/dingy but ok for a place to sleep. For the price in downtown, its hard to beat. Also, be advised they have no parking (typical for seattle), there are 2 huge parking garages though within a block or two of the hotel so you shouldn't have issues with that.",2
312,312,"Not bad at all The location is unmatchable in this price range. A simple sleeping room is $80 but expect to pay 2x's that anywhere else. It was surprisingly cleaner than most hotels I've seen in the past week but I've been driving up from LA and staying at Travelodge and Days Inn and Motel 6. The quality of the furnishings was high. Sure, it's a little run down in spots but it's just an old building with some of the usual character flaws but none affected the comfort. We were lucky enough also to get a corner room so that made it especially nice to look over at the W and know they are paying $250+/night. It had a full bath, everything worked -- we don't care to watch tv anyway on vacation so have no idea how that worked but if you want to believe all the other comments, feel free. It will mean more room for us when we come back.",3
313,313,"Dreadful Avoid this hotel at all costs. Even at half the price, it would still be throwing money away. While the location is very desirable, it is in disrepair, ugly, unclean, and generally unpleasant. The toilet in my room malfunctioned daily. The television would only pick up two stations. Although I had a great time with a friend in Seattle, I was happy to leave this hotel. It should not have a star rating at all.",1
314,314,"Old and Rundown The location was pretty nice, although it was on a steep hill. The TV was very old. We had problems with the heater in our room and had to bang on it a lot. We stayed here for a night and then moved to the Comfort Inn by the airport. It was too expensive to stay here for the value of the hotel.",2
315,315,"Compares to a motel I don't know how this hotel can get away with a description like: All of the guest rooms have been remodeled in a relaxing decor (from expedia), when the only thing that seemed to have been updated since the 1970s is the television. There is no room for toiletries in the bathroom, and the tiny pillows were very lumpy. If you don't mind staying at a Super 8 or Motel 6, you should stay here. Otherwise, I suggest you spend a few more bucks and stay elsewhere.",2
316,316,"Not a 2 Star Hotel Pros: Good safe downtown location. Walking distance to market, downtown stores, etc. Room and bathroom were clean. Request the non-smoking floor. Pleasant desk staff. Two coffee places around the corner. Cons: Looks like it hasn't been redecorated since the 1950's. An OK place if you want a simple place to sleep and shower. For the same room rate, the Executive Pacific Plaza (about 1/2 block away) is much nicer.",1
317,317,"Terrible! I've never had a worse experience at a hotel, and I travel a lot for business. The place is a dive...old, dirty and grungy.

Town car service available to and from the airport, immaculate rooms, spacious bathroom, great location. This is not a great hotel for the price, its a great hotel. Had a room facing the inner coutyard and there was no problem with noise. (Some rooms face onto First St. which is very noisy.) Location is excellent for anything in downtown Seattle.Went to attached restaurant Bacco for breakfast and Cafe Champagne for dinner. Both are excellent.",5
322,322,"Awesome room and hotel My wife and I just got back from a stay at the Inn at the Market and we had an excellent time. I mentioned that it was my wife's birthday so I was hoping for a good room. We were given room 311 which was considered a partial water view. We had an amazing view of both the Market and the Sound. The room had plenty of space and the bed was very comfortable. We were able to check in early and we immediately headed out to go shopping. When we returned to the hotel, we found small cupcakes in the room to celebrate the birthday which was a nice surpise. The hotel staff was super nice being responsive to our needs even calling us by name upon arrival. We ordered room service breakfast from Bacco and were impressed with the food. Our only minor complaint was the noise from the room heater. It was a little noisy which woke my wife up a couple of times. All in all, it was a very good stay!",5
323,323,An Inn that Cares This was my first stay at The Inn at the Market. The Inn seems to feel a bit more cozy then the big Hotel chains. I was pleasantly surprised by little touches that show this Inn cares if you return. We where there near Christmas they had Apple cider and cookies to welcome visitors. The proximity to the Market is awesome. Usually when I visit Seattle I can't bother to go down to the market because the traffic deters me. But to wake up and walk across the street was fabulous! Thanks to David Watkins he really takes pride in making sure visitors enjoy there stay.,5
324,324,"Perfect Choice We needed a place to stay in downtown Seattle for a few days, and having read the reviews on trip advisor, chose the Inn at the Market. It proved to be a great choice, the rooms are really well proportioned, with excellent views across the the mountains. The location could not be better, it is literally on top of Pike Place market, yet manages to shut out all the noise. To top off the experience, the staff are all extremely friendly and helpful, despite our best Mariah impressions. Only one negative to mention, the power outlet for the hairdryer is right by the sink, and looked a bit of a hazard.",5
325,325,"LIke a home from home On paper, there are better hotels around, but the friendliness of the staff has made this my personal favorite for longer stays in Seattle. The view of the sea and the market from some of the balconies is terrific. The location is good but it's still quiet. I'm quite picky and I've never had any complaint about the staff or the room here. Ask for your favorite room numbers because the rooms are all a little different. That's it's charm. The lobby's kind of small, so I don't recommend it for meetings!",4
326,326,"Perfect place to stay in Seattle Inn at the Market is the perfect place to stay if you're visiting Seattle. The location is the best in the city - at the Pike Place Market, which is so much fun! You can also walk to upscale shopping, the waterfront and aquarium, dozens of great restaurants, museums (including the must-see new Olympic Sculpture Park), and so much more.The staff was gracious and friendly. My room had an incredible view of the Market and the water. Be sure to visit the outdoor deck on the fifth floor - even if the weather doesn't cooperate, the views will impress. I slept very well in the comfy bed. I loved the daybed by the window, too - wish I had one at home!",5
327,327,"What a weekend! My work keeps me away from home, so usually the last thing I want to do is travel on MY free time. But the opportunity to come up to Seattle for a romantic getaway was too good to resist. Friends had told me about the Inn at the Market (I had never stayed there on biz), so my wife and I booked a room. What a great decision. Every part of our stay was terrific. The hotel is right in the heart of the Pike Place Market, and our room overlooked the water. Everything was perfect, and we had an enjoyable weekend touring the city and the Market. We enjoyed a bottle of wine on the rooftop deck and watched a spectacular sunset on Saturday. No question about it -- we'll be back.",5

329,329,"Great Hotel, Perfect Location My husband and I just returned from our first trip to Seattle and a wonderful four day stay at the Inn at the Market. The hotel was recommended by a friend and we couldn't have been more pleased.The hotel is well-maintained and very modern, but not stuffy. We had a lovely partial water view room - comfortable queen bed, small bay window with table and chairs, sofa, excellent armoire and closet storage, mini-bar with enough room to hold drinks, etc. we purchased elsewhere, and a large writing desk. The bathroom was modern yet warmly decorated. If there is one thing we could change, it would be to upgrade the TV channel selection. While it's true that you don't go on vacation to watch TV, it would have been nice to have entertaining television to watch a little before falling asleep and when we wanted to just relax and enjoy the room.The staff was very accommodating and friendly. Anything we asked for was taken care of with a smile, from making reservations for a tour of the Boeing plant (highly recommended, by the way) to printing out our boarding passes the night before we left.The location cannot be beat. The hotel is just steps from Pike's Market, and within walking distance to almost all of the major sights.One place not to be missed is the little french bakery, Le Panier. Exit the hotel on Stewart Street and turn left; cross at the corner and the bakery is on your right. (It faces the Market.)Zeek's Pizza on 5th  Denney is a great place to stop for lunch after seeing the Space Needle, which is only about a mile from the Inn.We can't wait to go back to Seattle and the Inn at the Market.",5
330,330,"Yet Another Happy Customer My husband and I just returned from a four night stay at the Inn at The Market. We loved it! We checked into the hotel immediately after climbing 9000ft of Mt. Rainier, so we really appreciated just how comfortable the hotel was. The staff was always happy to answer questions, and helped us with directions to restaurants a number of times. The room was a partial water view room, and was quite spacious - queen bed, table and chair by window, sofa and table, desk and chair. The bathroom was very nice. One thing that truly impressed me was that I had to request extra towels only on the first night. After that, we had extra towels every day. Also, the hotel supplied us with everything we needed for an in-room picnic: plates, silverware, napkins, wine glasses, corkscrew. I highly recommend foraging in the market for provisions and eating either in your room or on the 5th floor deck. All in all, our stay was extremely relaxed and comfortable. The location is wonderful, near lots of good restaurants. Go to Serious Pie and Wild Ginger.",5
331,331,"Perfect Location We booked a beautiful view room for early March 2008 for 4 days for our anniversary. Took a taxi from SEATAC. Nice and easy. Upon arrival to the hotel we found they upgraded us and provided us with chocolates and strawberries for our anniversary. Had a perfect view of the huge red Pike Market sign, the ferries and the water way along with all the landscape and surrounds. If you want to experience the market, water, ferry and shopping surroundings, this is the place for you. The outside roof top porch is a great place to take a couple drinks and watch the views. We got lucky as there was no rain during the 4 days. The room provided free umbrellas. I was sort of bummed being from Arizona and not a lot of rain, I personally was hoping for some. Bought fresh flowers at the market and the hotel provided a vase at no charge. Nice amentities, comfy bed and large tv in living room and a separate one in the bedroom. Completed the underground tour of the old city, pretty cool so don't miss it. Never took the ferry, but maybe next time. Just too much to do in 4 days around the general area. Lots of excellent places to eat and drink.",5
332,332,"Fantastic ! Just arrived home from our trip to Seattle. We had a wonderful time at this hotel. We had reserved a partial water view room and were pleasantly surprised when they upgraded us to a 7th floor townhome suite with a dramatic panoramic view of Elliott Bay. Absolutely spectacular !We didn't touch our car for 3 days. Everything was close, and we also took advantage of the free bus line that stops at the end of the block.We ate breakfast at Baccos (next door) where the staff was very friendly. I can't think of one thing I didn't like about this hotel !",5
333,333,"Great location and patio I stayed at this hotel in October and got lucky with the weather. It was sunny for most of my stay. As a result, I was able to take advantage of the fifth floor terrace overlooking the bay. I loved this feature of the hotel.The hotel is located across the street from the Pike Place Market so it's ideal for tourists. The downtown business district is an easy 5 or 6 block walk. The Inn is a smaller hotel that has been well maintained but shows its age a bit. All staff that I encountered were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is well suited for both business travellers and leisure travellers, including families.I booked a water view room which was quite large with fantastic views. The small sitting area in front of the windows was very nice. The bathroom was also decent size. I agree with the others who have stated that the mattresses are a bit uncomfortable. My room was on the fourth floor. I would stay at this hotel again but I would request a room on a higher floor as I experienced some eye opening late night noise from the courtyard below.",5
334,334,"Excellent location for Pike Place Market We stayed for three nights as part of our Silver Wedding Anniversary trip around the West Coast. The hotel had kindly left a card and chocolate covered strawberries in our room, which was a lovely gesture.The hotel is only a couple of minutes walk from Pike Place Market, one of the best markets I've ever seen and made me wish we had such quality markets in England.The hotel reception staff and the valet staff were very helpful and their welcome was very warm, which is unusual for large hotels.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Inn at the Market as a great place to stay.",5
335,335,"Everything I hoped This place is in a great location, literally over the road from Pike Market and about a 5 minute walk to the centre of the city. We originally werent sure whether to stay in the city, but given the Inn turned out to be so close to the city and that the Pike Markets are so colorful, it was a great choice.We didnt feel unsafe at any stage and in fact the mafority of the stranger types appeared to mainly reside in the city itself.There are plenty of places to eat very close by, from quick snacks to nice restaurants, so again location was excellent. We had breakfast at a small French patiserie about 2 minutes away that served great coffee and fantastic pasteries at a reasonable price.We were also impressed with the hotel. Although it doesnt look much from the outside, its been decorated modern but refined and the room was great. We tend to try and get a room with a view and in this case stayed in a Parlour Suite. While expensive, the room didnt let us down with both the view and quality. We were very happy and comfortable.Didnt try the hotels restaurants, but they always seemed to show up on the best in Seattle lists.So overall we couldnt have been happier at the Inn at the Market and would recommend it to anyone.",5
336,336,"A Stay We Will Long Remember My husband and I just returned from the most memorable stay in Seattle....and it was not for the lovely city of Seattle, the fun we had at the Seahawks game, the delicious dinners, or the beautiful views of the bay from our hotel. We have stayed at the Inn At The Market before. All have been wonderful, however, this visit touched me in ways no other visit has. I am so very grateful to the staff at the Inn At The Market, but particularily to our room maid, Josie. When packing up to leave our lovely room, I placed my travel bag of jewelry on the bed. We went out for breakfast. Upon returning we packed our bags and checked out. Enroute home, 5 hours from the hotel, when I remembered my jewelry. I forgot to pack it, leaving it on the unmade bed. In the bag was my wedding ring, my diamond engagement ring, a diamond pendant, pearls, among others....precious pieces that I have had for our 32 years of marriage. I immediately called the hotel to report my loss. The maid had registered my jewelry bag, sealed it, and sent it to the front desk. It was there when I called. The front desk staff packaged it up and sent it UPS to me in Canada. I received it, all intact, within 3 days. I am so grateful to Josie and the staff at The Inn At The Market. Thank you all so very much for your kindness.We will look forward to our next visit to your beautiful city and especially to The Inn At The Market.",5
337,337,"location, ambiance, luxury--what more could you want? We had but one night in Seattle on a tour of the pacific northwest and we wanted to be able to have a great view and experience downtown Seattle. What a great choice we made with the Inn at the Market. We were upgraded to a full water view, which was fabulous! The room was not huge, but the view made up for that, and everything about the hotel was first-rate, from check-in to check-out. The rooftop garden was incredible--even at the beginning of October, we were able to sit out for both breakfast and cocktail hour, enjoying the view and the weather. Being right next to the Pike Market was terrific--we enjoyed the shopping and eating. This is a great hotel and the perfect spot to experience Seattle!",5
338,338,Great place to stay in Seattle Inn at the Market is a wonderful place to stay in Seattle. The expense is a bit more then I usually spend but it was worth it because the hotel is located right next to Pike's Place Market. The view can't be beat in all Seattle. There's a wonderful balcony to watch a romantic sunset. When checking in at the hotel my husband and I were pleasantly surprised to receive a room upgrade to a suite. Since we were celebrating our anniversary it made the stay that much more special. I only wish we were able to stay a little longer then planned. The bed was very comfortable due to the quality of the mattress. I wanted to take it home with me. The front desk staff were very helpful in making a dinner recommendation and reservation for us. Again we were surprised when we were greeted at the restaurant (Cutter's) with ribbon decorations and a candle on the table. The hotel treated us to an appetizer also. We felt like VIPs. I recommend the Inn at the Market for a romantic getaway in an exciting city.,5
339,339,"Excellent Boutique Hotel Recently we celebrated our 38th wedding anniversary at Inn At The Market.

The terrace on the fifth floor is perfect for relaxing during the day or evening. From the moment we booked our reservations we could not have asked for a more professional, friendly, or helpful staff. Everyone on the IATM team went out of their way to insure that our time with them was indeed special.

Very close to the makets and city shopping area. Staff were only too heapful to assist with directions.Some rooms dont have views so the higher the better facing the harbour,5
341,341,"Perfect location; great stay We needed a hotel for just one night, prior to departing on a cruise. This hotel was perfect for us. Great location, just steps from the Market. We enjoyed walking around the area. We booked two rooms; both were clean and comfortable but on the small side. Bellmen went out of their way to help us and give info on the area. We really loved the fifth-floor terrace. We enjoyed both an afternoon snack and breakfast there; we picked up food from a couple of the many nearby eating places. We highly recommend the cheese shop at the bottom of the hill.I would probably choose this hotel again when returning to Seattle.",4
342,342,"location, location, location This is a great boutique hotel. It is not the typical huge, rubber stamp type facility. We loved this hotel. The bell men and front desk staff were great. They went out of their way to make sure our stay was great. We were there for our 25th anniversary. We arrived and found two chocolate strawberries situated on our already turned down bed. A large bucket of ice was ready for champagne. The bed was very comfy and we were delighted to find it was a Temperpedic (memory foam) bed, which is what we have at home. We spent two nights at the Inn at the Market before a cruise to Alaska and one night upon our return. Literally every staff member made sure to mention that all staff were trained to help with conceirge duties and they were all very helpful to help us find our way around, providing maps and bus information. We ate breakfast across the street in the market, where you are really hardpressed to not find a large variety of food. The other morning we had pastry and coffee in a french pastry shop just down the street. We picked up great fruit to snack on in our room. We ate at Etta's one night and had delicious fresh oysters, halibut and fabulous coconut creme pie for dessert. One night we selected a variety of cheeses, crab, bread, olives, berries, peaches and things from various shops in the market. We bought some wine from Cost Plus, just down the street and had a little picnic up on the 5th floor deck. It was great! Gosh, we just had a great time and the situation of the hotel made it perfect for a nap before dinner and stopping back in to drop off packages. We were greeted each time we came and left by the very friendly staff. The staff called for cabs for us when we needed to get to far away destinations. They were wonderful!! So, a nice clean room, comfy bed, great bathroom, perfect location, great garden deck to watch the bustling crowd below. They have coffee/tea in the lobby....as much as a person could possibly want! I scampered down in my bathrobe once and nobody seemed to care.....just like most boutique hotels, you sort of feel at home. So...if you are looking for convenience, great staff, nice hotel...not cookie cutter...this is the place. I am surprised to read some of the less than favorable reviews. Perhaps these will make it easier for folks like me to get reservations. I spoke with a number of people up on the 5th floor deck who always stay at the Inn and know that a reservation well in advance is necessary. It seemed the saavy travelers enjoyed this facility. The others may be more comfortable in one of the corporate high rises. But for us.....we will be at the Inn and tell our family to also stay here.",5
343,343,"We had a very nice experience at the Inn at the Market! We stayed at the Inn at the Market over a long Labor Day weekend. I've read a lot of mixed reviews on the Inn and all I can say is we had a really nice experience there.We're not big on paying a lot for a view in any hotel room because we just don't spend that much time in our room so we opted for a city view. We were in room 408 and it has a view of the courtyard that you walk through as you enter the hotel. For a view of the water, we were very satisfied with simply going up to the 5th floor deck where you had an unlimited view of Elliot Bay, Mt. Rainier, the waterfront and everything you'd see if you had a water view room. We took so many pictures from the deck and just stood there and admired the view. It was a nice place to strike up a conversation with other guests and overall, a nice place to escape the hustle of the Market area below.Our room was lovely and spacious and we saw no signs of any of the wear and tear that some reviews have mentioned. The bathroom in our room was the size of a small bedroom! And one thing I really loved about the bathroom was the shelving unit available for us to put our bathroom things on. Every hotel should offer this so that you don't have to live completely out of your suitcase or have a thousand things on the back of the toilet simply for them to be handy.The tempurpedic bed got a mixed review. I had no issues with it and found it quite comfortable. My husband...not so much. He would have liked a firmer mattress and he said he felt as if he was sleeping on his head the entire time. Overall though, it was fine.We don't normally make a lot of use of concierge services, etc. and we're not big users of room service either so I can't speak a lot about that. We did order dessert through room service one night and it was very nice. For breakfast, we went to the Market Bagel shop over on 1st Ave. (about 1/2 block south of the hotel) for a very inexpensive breakfast a couple of days. One day we walked a few blocks to a nearby coffee shop (no, not Starbucks...we avoided corporate coffee), Cafe Ladro. VERY good coffee and pastries and worth the 6 or 7 blocks to walk.Dinners were mostly eaten in and around the Market area. We can highly recommend Shiro Sushi (again, within easy walking distance) and it was highly recommended to us by one of the front desk staff. (Just a tip: Ivar's is so overrated don't waste your time. We live in the Midwest and we've had fish here that was so much better than that Long John Silver's knockoff.)The Market area itself is a zoo. If you don't like walking into people/crowds in general, you'll go nuts here after a couple of days. Granted, we were there over a holiday weekend and during the last day of Bumbershoot but even after that ended, it was still nuts. It really wasn't the crowds that got to us so much as the buskers (annoying with a capital A and basically everywhere you turn) and the seemingly endless supply of insane people. That was our biggest takeaway from Seattle: is every third person on the street insane? Not that we ever felt threatened, quite the contrary. But we had people just randomly yell at us (and everyone else around them), hiss at us like a cat, skateboard by us singing a song about Chairman Mao...it seemed to never end. I guess you can call it free street theatre.The Inn is in the midst of all this and we were definitely at the heart of all the action. The bell staff was incredibly friendly, the front-desk staff was helpful, the room was very nice, the location was tourism ground zero. Not really sure how we could have improved on the experience. (Oh and it was sunny and 68 every day we were there! So much for the Seattle drizzle experience!) Honestly if I had one complaint it would be the TV channel selection. There are about 20 channels, half of which are sports, the other half local government and news. Boring, boring, boring. But again, we don't go on vacation to watch TV. But if you're looking for something interesting to watch as you fall asleep...good luck to you my friend.If we were going back to Seattle and wanted to stay in the city itself, I wouldn't hesitate to go back to Inn at the Market.",4
344,344,"Big Disappointment Went there for a weekend getaway. Very disappointed at the low level of service: no room service during the day (after 5:30 only), stains on the sheets, loud A/C that was alternately freezing and hot  stuffy, bellman about ran me down as I was trying to get out of the elevator, furniture getting pretty worn, bad breakfast.Will not be back and cannot recommend it. 2 star hotel at a 4 star rate.",2
345,345,"Convenient Pluses for Inn at the Market - comfy bed, decent sized room with two cozy arm chairs, convenient to stroll Pike Place MarketMinuses - when we read boutique hotel we expect something special. We were disappointed. Nonexistent concierge service is one of our gripes. Also, for an 8 story boutique hotel where you would expect above average service, we were surprised to see the note that we must make our room available by 9:00 AM or we would not be serviced AT ALL! Hey, we're on vacation, would like to sleep later. Food recommendation for breakfast by the front desk staff was awful. We did better with coffe and croissants in Pike Place Market. I'm just glad we chose a less expensive street view room rather than the $325 one.",3
346,346,"Inn Okay, Not Memorable We were spending four days in Seattle prior to flying to Alaska, and after reading many reviews of different Seattle hotels, I chose this hotel on the basis of the Tripadvisor reviews. Every review I saw was glowing, and I also liked the location. We travel frequently and have stayed in many different hotels, both chain and otherwise. I have to say we were somewhat disappointed. The location is very nice, true. The hotel was nice inside, but we never saw the reason for the glowing reviews. The room was nice but not exceptional. The men who bring in luggage and get you cabs went to great lengths to help us. The desk staff was certainly very pleasant and helpful, but at least two of them didn't know how to put us in touch with a company who could take us to Mt. Rainier. There are no brochures available in the lobby, and when the desk person went looking in a drawer, he had difficulty finding a brochure for this major attraction. I finally suggested Gray Line myself, and he made the phone call for us, but then gave us incorrect information (and I saw later why he thought that he was accurate---I don't blame him for that). My husband found out later on that there was a concierge somewhere on site, but in four days we never saw him/her or even knew of his/her presence. The hotel needs better visible information for tourists---at the very least, brochures should be somewhere. In addition, once we did book our tour, we asked for a wake up call that never came. Fortunately I always set my cell phone. We came away feeling that while our stay there was fine, we had had similar fine experiences in the chain hotels all over the US. We felt that it wasn't worth the extra money.",3
347,347,"You won't find a better place than this! We just returned from a weekend stay at the Inn. We wanted a great room in a great location as we were without a car. This is THE place to stay in Seattle if you are interested in wandering the streets on foot and sightseeing the Pike Place Market neighborhood. You are right across the street from the Market and in the middle of great shopping and restaurants. It is only about a few blocks to West Lake Centre and the monorail to the Space Needle. When you get tired of strolling around this great city just head back to your beautiful room at the Inn. If you are wondering where good customer service has gone, look no further. The Inn has obviously put alot of effort into hiring/training customer focused staff. Don't waste your time or money looking anywhere else.",5

349,349,"~ Seattle Boutique Hotel We visited Seattle for a week in July and stayed at this wonderful hotel overlooking Pike's Market. Our spaciouis room was on the top floor with a partial water view that was stunning. The roof top garden is the place to relax above the bustle of the city. I highly reccomend this property. The city is very noisy at night, so close your windows and turn on the fan and you will sleep well! Be sure and get over to Hurricane Ridge, and kayak on Lake Union. Ladies, Nordstrom's basement store is a 5 min walk from the hotel!",5
350,350,Really enjoyed staying at the Inn at the Market Stayed one night at this exceptional hotel. We were upgraded to a suite overlooking the market and water. There is also a rooftop area with chairs and tables that all guests can use that overlooks both market and water. The staff was friendly and helpful and the rooms were nice and clean. All areas of hotel were well taken care of. It was close to the market and waterfront and a block away from the tour bus that you can get on and off at different stops. Would stay there again.,5
351,351,"Don't consider staying anywhere else in Seattle The best location, staff, facilities, view. Don't bother to look at any other hotels in Seattle. Stay here.",5
352,352,"Great Location, friendly staff We stayed in the hotel over Easter and throughly enjoyed our time there. It is superably located for exploring Seattle especially the Market and the rooms were of a good size.The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful and the reception area is very welcoming.Our only 'criticism' would be that our room was next to a fire exit stairwell and at night we could hear the rumbling of what I assume was something like the air conditioning pipes.",5
353,353,Can't wait to go back! The hotel was very nice and in a great location if you want to get out and see seattle by foot. The upper deck offers a great view of the market and the the bay. We drank coffee in the morning and capped our nigts watching the sun set drinkng a nice glass of wine on the deck. The service was great and the employees were great to deal with. Our room was very nice and big enough for what we needed.,5
354,354,"Fantastic waterview and exceptional location We just returned from a 3 week trip to the Northwest and Alaska. The Inn at the Market was the first hotel we stayed at. It still stands out as a hotel that I would recommend to friends going to Seattle. I booked this hotel directly and immediately had the feeling I would be happy there. The girl on the other end of the line could not have been more friendly or willing to please. When we arrived we were quickly taken up to our room and famiiarized with what the room had to offer. We had booked a two story suite which was perfect for my husband, myself and daughter. We all had our privacy and my daughter had a separate tv and pull out couch that was made up immediately on request. We all had the same great view of the water and the public market. The hotel has a lovely patio that overlooks the water. It is raised so provides a wonderful view. My daughter and I went out there after dinner and had a wonderful relaxing chat about our day before going upstairs to bed. The only negative would be that there is only one bathroom and it is upstairs (and the stairs would not be good for someone handicapped although my husband struggles with walking because of car accident and he had no complaints) so if you aren't a good sharer and you are traveling with more then your spouse/friend take this into consideration. We had friends come in from Vancouver the last night of our stay and the hotel was very good about finding us last minute reservations for five to accomodate their arrival time. I will say that we were very lucky weatherwise and that on foggy, drizzly or rainy days that our impressions might not have been quite so good but that would not be the hotel's fault. I have also read other reviews from fellow travelers that did not give the hotel high marks for rooms with city views because of noise. However, I always think you get what you pay for. One other big plus for this hotel is its proximity to the Public Market. It is literally a two minute walk. Bingo! and if you are a Starbucks fan the original store is about a 4 minute walk......",5
355,355,"Quintessential Seattle Inn at the Market was an absolutely exquisite experience, made all the more so because it was a surprise gift from my teenage daughter. She knew that I had been lusting to stay at this jewel of a boutique hotel ever since I read the wonderful review which Sunset Magazine gave it. Every time we passed by it when strolling through Pike Market, I would say: I wish we could stay one night at Inn at the Market. We live less than an hour's drive from Seattle in the Tacoma area, so we don't usually do overnights in Seattle. Besides, we are loyal Best Western guests, and Inn at the Market is more than double the rate of even the finest Best Western motel.Inn at the Market is quintessential Seattle - friendly, casual yet elegant, pleasing to the senses, practical. For reasons unknown, we were upgraded to a suite with gorgeous water views (my daughter insists she did not tell the hotel that we were celebrating my 55th birthday). The location can't be beat - in the heart of Pike Market, next to a fine (but pricey) French restaurant. The hotel itself houses a breakfast and lunch cafe which we wish we had tried, as the food fragrances were yummy and the place was packed. All day in-and-out valet parking (extra charge) made it easy to tour Seattle without fearing the loss of precious parking.In short - this wonderful Seattle hotel is worth the splurge in every way, shape, and form. Claire B - thanks for leading me to this place. Nancy W - your love and generosity made this hotel an added beautiful experience.",5
356,356,"Best in Seattle For my first visit to Seattle I chose this hotel because it seemed to have the best location. When I arrived I found out that I was exactly right. The views from the rooftop patio were Fantastic. The bedrooms were perfect with great amenities, i.e. designer shampoos/soaps, bed was memory foam, bathroom was clean and gorgeous. The staff were not far from my age(24) and when I needed advice on where to go for drinks they gave me their best. Everyone that worked there was perfect. When I return to Seattle this is likely the only place where I will stay. The Best!",5
357,357,"Nice location but request a decent room! The location is fabulous if you want to be in the center of Pike Street Market. However, I had the absolute worst room in the entire hotel. They said, city view. I had a view of a red brick wall. After a long day of travel, I wanted a bath. They had given me a handicapped room. The room was larger than say a Hilton and nice appointments, but nothing special. No one ever asked how my stay way or I would have told them. If they had let me know the room was so so it might have helped. I don't think they were even close to full either. I was on the floor with the conference rooms. What a joy in the morning. Thank goodness I met up with a friend to walk around Seattle and stay out late - Wild Ginger is fabulous!",3
358,358,"Excellent in every way We stayed at the Inn at the Market over Memorial Day weekend. Our room was large and had a great view of the water (we'd made sure to request that way in advance). The hotel was quiet and though fully booked, never seemed crowded. Service was impeccable and the whole staff was well-mannered and friendly. I can't find any fault with anything.It's in a great location right next to Pike Place Market, near lots of great restaurants like Etta's and Chez Shea.",5
359,359,"The best customer service anywhere at any price This is my first 5 dot TripAdvisor review. I didn't think I would ever give that to any hotel.This place is amazing! Perfect location, incredible rooms, and the finest men and women in customer service I've ever experienced.We check in, and immediately people know you by name and greet you. Every day I was greeted, and everything I needed was retrieved immediately.I got to my room. The toilet was running slightly, so I called down and it was fixed, including replacement parts, within a matter of minutes. I needed a rollaway for an extra guest.. it was provided at turndown later that evening and was turned down and made like a regular bed. I needed an extension cord, as we had two laptops and a assortment of other devices to plug in. It was at my room within 2 or 3 minutes.The bed was a firmer variant of the memory foam beds, and was amazing. They only offer queen size beds in this hotel, but since I was single this time around, that wasn't an issue. I never slept better in a hotel.The bathroom was amazing. It was half the size of the room, at least, and had plenty of space for 2 people and their toiletries. It had several lighting options as well. You could change it from late night to boardroom with an assortment of switches. In addition, I felt the supplied soaps and shampoos were excellent and felt no need to augment them.Every hallway, restroom, and staff member was immaculate in apperance and maintenance. I was not missing anything and I DID NOT want to leave.",5
360,360,"Absolute Fabulous Inn Enough good things cannot be said about this property. From the time I called the Inn to book until my departure, the entire staff at this hotel was above and beyond excellence. I stayed one night pre-cruise on May 2 and was upgrade to a suite which overlooked the city/market area. The rooms were huge and the bed with the temp. mattress was to die for. Ordered room service which was very prompt and delicious. The greatest thing about my stay was the staff on duty that day. Everyone was extremely helpful in all manners and most pleasant. If every hotel had this particular staff, rooms would be over booked. If you have time, definitely use the fifth floor terrace for a cocktail. It overlooks the market and has great sunsets.......all this while watching the ships come and go. Such a peaceful late afternoon cannot be beat! I was sad to go the next morning at check-out.....when in Seattle I will always stay at this property.",5
361,361,"Amazing Location with Great Views Fabulous boutique hotel adjacent to the fish market in Seattle. We stayed here for one short night before heading to Vancouver Island on our honeymoon, and we loved it. The service was great, and the front desk pointed us to a great spot for sandwiches at 10pm on a Sunday (not easy to do!) - the hotel had even put adorable chocolate covered strawberries in our room decorated like a bride and groom. This was a thoughtful and cute touch. We didn't have much time to explore the area around the hotel, but the room was very clean, we had a pretty view of the water/market and the bathroom was nicer than a standard hotel bathroom. We had brunch in the morning at the little breakfast place, which was tasty and hit the spot before our drive to the ferries.Oh, and the hotel has a cool outdoor patio on one of the higher floors that offers really incredible views.A stone's throw to Pike Place Market, too!",4
362,362,"such ennui Stayed here earlier this week and from the beginning met with annoying customer service staff - Felix especially a drama queen - and less than stellar accomodations. Soap/shampoo (Gilchrist and Solmes) same as used in Navy lodging. Our room came with a 'courtyard' view which is actually facing a brick wall. NO exercise facility, small business 'center' and some construction to boot. Most importantly, the room we held did NOT have a desk so how in the world can one begin to think about working. Would not stay there again...",2
363,363,"Outstanding choice We reserved a city view room for one night last week. Upon checkin, the helpful desk staff Amy gave us a complimentary upgrade to the 8th floor water view. We had access to the large deck which overlooks seemingly everything. Checkin, housekeeping, valet services and checkout were smooth and friendly. The Pike Place Market is so close it's silly. The staff had great recommendations for breakfast and dinner without trying to steer us to their in house restaurant (which, from our last stay, I can say is absolutely excellent). The rooms are clean and well appointed. I have no reason to not reserve a room here next time-althought the Fairmont is a better choice if our kids come.",5
364,364,Very cute We stayed here with my husband and my in-laws for a night before our cruise to Alaska. This hotel is in such great location. I really liked way it was laid out because it's very cute. The rooms are big and they have a great restaurant. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again.,5
365,365,"Loved this boutique hotel We stayed at the Inn at the Market for our anniversary a few years ago. After all this time, we still remember it very fondly and would love to return. The service was amazing. We had last minute car problems and the hotel came to our rescue, so we wouldn't miss the reservation. We loved being referred to by name when coming into the lobby. The conceirge was also fabulous. Yes, the rooms were small. However, they were very well appointed and I loved the city view. I happened to be in the room during housekeeping one day and the maid said to be comfortable while she brewed me a fresh pot of coffee, then poured and delivered it to me in the bone china cups provided in the room.",4
366,366,"great location in a fabulous city I've stayed at this and many other Seattle hotels over the years, and Inn at the Market always comes through.

We chose the City View package as we have stayed in Seattle many times and weren't planning on staying in the room too much.Unfortunately the City View rooms sit right on First Ave. Buses, vagrancy, street noise. Pretty tough environment.Would stay again but would chose to spend a bit more and have a view of the Sound.",4

We arrived very late at night and had been upgraded without asking. There was some construction going on the next morning so we were given a room on a higher floor to be further away from any noise disturbance.It was a minute or two walk from the Public Market. There was a lot to see within walking distance.The beds were extremely comfortable. the only down side was that you had to walk outside for a few seconds to get to some of the rooms.We had contact with many people at the front desk, all of whom were very happy to help and full of all kinds of information.

We upgraded to a water view room, and had a great view from the sixth floor out onto Elliot Bay, counting the WA State ferries shuttling between Bainbridge Island and Bremerton to Seattle. The room was large, well appointed, and quiet. The property is interesting, given it has three eateries and a spa/salon integrated into the structure. But we ate elsewhere, since there is an abundance of great restaurants and specialty eateries within a short walking distance. Breakfast on First at Crumpets (wonderful), dinner at Etta's down the street on Western, and a wonderful reco from the desk staff right across the street at 94 Stewart. You have got to try the special avacado appetizer! Easy walk to major shopping and the monorail to the Space Needle. By the way, definitely eat at the retaurant at the top. The food was suprisingly good!We only spent two nights ... but based on the beautiful room and facility, proximity to the Market, the view, and the great staff, we will be back!",5

375,375,Class ACT I recently spent my 60th b-day at the Inn at the Market. I spent days searching through the list of hotels trying to find the perfect one. I wanted to wake up in a special hotel since I was really dreading this birthday. The minute we walked in the room we knew we were in the right place. The accomodations are huge and everything has a touch of class. The bed was so comfortable we didn't want to get up. I am a travel agent and would highly recommend this hotel. Linda Lawrence,5
376,376,"Great Hotel What a great hotel! Good sized, clean rooms. Very helpful staff. Unbeatable location. Walk out the front door to Pikes Market and the original Starbucks.

Great restaurants are within a very short walk (or in the courtyard). Avoid rooms on the 1st street side, especially the low floors, because of the traffic noise. If the weather is good, make sure you give the terrace some time.",4

380,380,"Darling inn! I am a frequent contributor to TripAdvisor, and I often review the hotels where I have stayed. I chose Inn at the Market because of the great reviews on TripAdvisor, and I was very pleased! Staying at Inn at the Market was a great experience. The valet and front-desk staff were extremely friendly, welcoming, punctual, and helpful. My room was comfortable. I often feel in hotels like I don't really want to let my bare feet touch the floor, but my room felt like a comfortable home-away-from-home. I had not slept on a Tempurpedic bed before, and it was very comfortable. The bathrom was spacious, toiletries were lovely, and shower was well-designed. The Seattle Athletic Club down the street was terrific. It is $15/day to use the facilities there, but really worth it if you're someone who needs to work out while you're traveling. It was wonderful to be right in the heart of things in Seattle, too. I enjoyed walking around the fish market, stopping at the original Starbucks for tea in the mornings, and eating at nearby restaurant The Pink Door. The one disappointment for me was the lack of breakfast, not a huge deal since there is a restaurant attached to the inn where you can order breakfast (though it is sit-down, not quick take-out) and many other restaurants nearby, but a slight inconvenience. As long as you're prepared for that, and leave time to find breakfast elsewhere, this won't be an issue. The rooftop deck offered a lovely view of the Puget Sound. Turndown service each night with chocolate was a nice touch. I would definitely stay again for business or pleasure.",4
381,381,"Had some drawbacks... My husband and I were excited about staying at the Inn at the Market, due to the great reviews. Our room was a standard one, with a somewhat disappointing view of the wall of the building across the courtyard, on the 3rd floor. Not a big deal, since we could go up to the rooftop terrace if we wanted a great view. I will say the best thing about the Inn was the location. Pike Place Market is a great place to leisurely explore, and it's right there. My husband walked down across the street every morning to get fresh hot croissants and coffee for breakfast, and we visited the bakeries many times for late night snacks.My biggest complaint was the Tempurpedic mattress. Everyone else in these reviews rave about them, but my back hated it! I have chronic low back pain anyway (and was 6 months pregnant when we went), and was really looking forward to some great sleep, but wound up hurting terribly. In fact, I wound up having to sleep sitting up in bed because laying down was so painful. On our 3rd day there I asked the person at the front desk if I could get a cot in my room because the bed was really uncomfortable to me and they told me it was against fire code. I don't know if that's the truth or not, but it sure wasn't what I wanted to hear. They didn't seem to care too much that a pregnant patron wasn't able to sleep at all on their beds.Smaller complaints: my husband and I stopped at the front desk to ask directions from Discovery Park over to the zoo, two of the places we were planning on visiting. The girl handed us a Budget rental car map and circled each place on there for us. She didn't try to help us out with the best route to take from one to the next, even though we asked, just pointed out each place again as if to brush us off. Obviously we can read a map and did find our way, but I was once again disappointed in the service. Also, the room was very noisy due to all the street noise, especially in the morning as trucks unloaded their stuff for the day at the market. It didn't bother us too badly, because we sleep with a white noise machine which helps to mask it. I can't imagine the racket we would have had to listen to without it. So be aware of that potential problem.Overall, our experience was still pleasant, though, mostly due to the location of the hotel. The room was clean, the bathroom large and nicely stocked, and the terrace view was really amazing. However, we can't go back because of the beds which is a shame. They should offer some rooms without the Tempurpedic mattresses.",3
382,382,"Great view and location but rooms lack personality The inn is billed as a boutique hotel, however the room lacked charm. It was so generic, it felt like we were at a Holiday Inn (but for $300+ a night). It would be so easy for the hotel to add a few prints of the Public Market or original paintings sold at Pike Place...something that had to do with Seattle and the Pacific Northwest. Our room had a fantastic view of Elliott Bay. The Tempur Pedic bed was very comfortable, however the sales brochures for the mattress in the nightstand was a big turn-off.The bathroom was very large and stocked with top notch products. The front lobby and housekeeping staff were very helpful and room service arrived in record speed.",3
383,383,We Love the Inn at the Market       View from Our room,5
384,384,"Great Place My husband  I just got back yesterday from Seattle. Our stay at The Inn at The Market was wonderful. I agree that the layout of the room is awkward for watching the television. The view from the 5th floor deck was breathtaking the setting was very relaxing. You are literally next door to the maket  there are plenty of restaurants within walking distance. I loved the bath robes, turn down service  chocolates. The staff was friendly  eager to help in any way they could. Would stay again.",4
385,385,"Great Experience We stayed at the Inn at the Market in Seattle during the second week of August and really enjoyed our stay. The hotel's location (literally) next to Pike Place Market is ideal! You can walk around the market to explore yet still walk around the city quite easily. The hotel is a bit on the expensive side, but really has a lot of qualities that make it very desirable. The rooftop terrace is awesome! The rooms sometimes have a weird arrangement (i.e. TV was at the side of the bed, so you had to lay on the bed sideways to watch). But overall the rooms were very nice with comfortable bedding, updated furniture, complimentary in-room internet access. The guest service was also excellent. Our check-in/check-out was pleasant and quick. The bell staff, valet parking staff, and housekeeping were always very helpful, timely, and accomodating. They also have a complimentary car service that can drop off/pick up for intown locations. Overall, we had a great stay and would certainly stay at this property again while visiting Seattle.",4
386,386,Perfect location at a fair price       Have breakfast on the roof!,5
387,387,"I loved this place! Yes, we payed $300 a night but we knew that going in and the hotel exceeded our expectations. We arrived early, around 11 am, and went into the Inn to store our luggage. We were told our room was ready so we were able to check in right then, wonderful news! The room and bathroom were large and the bed was extremely comfortable. Everything was tastefully appointed. Service was always immediate and professional. This was our first trip to Seattle and the location was outstanding! Pike Place Market was fabulous; a perfect blend of tourists and locals. We used the fifth floor deck every day. We really, really enjoyed our stay at Inn at the Market and would stay again.",5
388,388,"great location We spent 3 nights at this hotel recently and loved it!! It IS expensive but we had one of the rooms with two doubles and had plenty of room for myself, my husband, and two teenage girls. The views are spectacular and the service is excellent. The rooftop is perfect for anytime of day. I went up early to read or late in the evening to relax. We could not get enough of the view and were within easy walking range of many sites and restaurants. I walked no more thatn two blocks in any direction in the mornings to sample different coffee shops.",5
389,389,"Location, views and lively spot       View from our room (considered partial ocean)",5
390,390,"expensive for what you get. not for biz travellers. The simple fact is the hotel's location is simply unbeatable.. a mere stone's throw away from Pike Market. Plenty of great restaurants to go to and it is generally a fun area to be in. That is if you are a tourist. However, the quality of the hotel itself is only so-so. This is not a place for business travellers. I might be a bit hard on them especially since I just returned from a trip to HK where I stayed at the Conrad HK and Wynn Macau. Compared to those the Inn feels like motel 6. Issues:1. There is no desks in the rooms to place your laptops on. Even if you have wireless internet, there is no place to work on but your bed. 2. Furniture and coverings are worned and just outdated. 3. Room 409 is a city view room. The last room they had for that date. Avoid at all cost because its window sits right above the bus stop. They claim that the windows are double paned but I could hear the buses' roaring engines. I had to sleep with ear plugs which they had at the front desk. 4. The AC is a standalone unit attached to the wall. This is not part of a central system. The standalone unit made quite a bit of noise. It looks cheap and tacky too. 5. There is no business center. Only a fax machine located in the basement of the hotel. For the price you pay you are paying for the location only. The staff are extremely friendly though. Folks should check out the fried doughnuts at the Dhalia Lounge.",3
391,391,"Location This was my fifth or sixth visit to the Inn at the Market. The property is better than most: the lobby is handsome, the rooms comfortable (though a little tired and ready for renovation, especially in the case of the bathrooms), the sun deck overlooking the harbor is a treat, and the staff is welcoming. The related restaurants, including not only Campagne but the related bistro in the basement and the lively breakfast place located separately within the same building, are really good. But the whole ballgame here is the location. The views, if you are fortunate enough to have a water-view room, are simply stunning -- not only because of the comings and goings of ferry boats, freighters, liners, Coast Guard cutters, fishing boats, and pleasure craft, but also because of the astonishing mountain range visible across Elliott Bay, which catches the sunset in truly glorious ways. It is also a pleasure to be able to walk half a block down the steep hill to the Pike Place Market, with all its produce and its bustle of activity. There are countless restaurants and clubs within walking distance. As gentrification neuters most of downtown Seattle, this area remains edgy, even a little challenging if you go in certain directions at certain times. The area is not for you if you are uncomfortable with street people and occasional strong smells. It is also a little inconvenient for business; and the business services in the hotel are not comparable to those in a Hyatt or a Marriott. But the tradeoff is a real sense of place, something you can't get in other cities or in Seattle's uptown hotels.",4
392,392,Expensive but great spot       Our bathroom,3
393,393,"pleasant We were in 706, wiith the taxes it was slightly over $400/night. We had a nice water view. When we had our windows open we got the traffic noises from hwy 99 and the noise and cooking smells from the restaurant Campagne. Location is good for first time tourists.The staff was helpful and nice, the rooms were clean and the housekeeping staff was excellent. The bathroom was spacious and clean but some what dated. There were limited TV channels -- no HBO, etc.All and all, a comfortable hotel but on the expensive side.",4
394,394,"A view with a room. Spent two nights with my wife over the 4th. We had a bay view room that was more than we could have hoped for. Great view of the fireworks. This is a world unto itself after walking all day in Seattle. A great place to come back to. Pikes Place market is at your door step so the location is perfect. Try to stay as high ( as in floor height) as you can as the market opens early and there can be some noise. The beds are the posturepedic foam and are everything that they claim. We slept really well. I think if we ever go back to Seattle, this was our second time, we wouldn't stay anywhere else. Room service was right on time and all food we had in the room, and in the restaurants, was quite good.One other thing about the view, you have Mt. Renier to your left, facing the bay, and the snow capped Cascades in frount and to the right , it's postcard great.",5
395,395,"Loved this Hotel!! I just returned from a wonderful 4 night stay at the Inn at the Market. The most wonderful feature of this boutique hotel is its location which is literally at the Pikes Pier market. It was wonderful to be able to simply step out of our hotel and walk through the market. From our hotel window we watched as the flower booths were setup, we watched cruise ships, ferries, and the bustle of the market activity. Wonderful. When we arrived we found that our room had only 1 queen bed and we expressed that we would prefer 2 queen beds. They made every effort to accommodate this request and we were given a room with a pullout sofa -- it suited us very well. The room was not large but it was very clean and well furnished and suited our needs. We also enjoyed the deck on the 5th floor which is nicely furnished with deck furniture and affords a great view of the water and the market. 4th of July firewords viewed from the deck are spectacular. We also found the staff to be very friendly and competent. All of the desk personnel are concierges. They booked several reservations and cruises for us. The only area which I felt could possibly be improved was the room service menu. The room service is provided by a restaurant which shares the courtyard called Campagne. We found the menu to be too limited and the items too obscure to be appealling. However it was of little matter since the area that the hotel is situated is surrounded by a large number of restaurants and eateries. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this lovely boutique hotel!",5
396,396,"Great location! Close to almost everything! I walked everywhere!. It's just a few blocks to Nordstroms, Art Museum, ferries and more. It was fun to walk out the door and be at the market too. We loved the deck, the room was nice and clean and the bed was the best! The chocolates on the turndown were so good! We would definately stay here again. Also we had a wonderful meal at Le Campagne and the waiter was the best.",5
397,397,"Nice place! After a lunatic 20000+ miles of flying in the space of a few days, I had a night to kill in Seattle before an early trans-con flight back to NYC. Couldnt last out all night as was the original plan, so needed a hotel, and had none prebooked.This place was recommended to me , and was just a block or so from the excellent irish pub (kells) I just happened to have ended up in.Just one room left, at $220 inc tax.Excellent friendly staff, lovely decor, big rooms (im used to NYC so a rabbit hutch will seem big , but these were indeed spacious).Great views out over the water and it has free wi-fi, you just need to ask at reception for the access code. Place seemed spotless and nicely decorated, and more individual then the usual bland chain hotels that sadly prevail.The area felt fine-in the limited time I was there it seemed safe and near to bars, shops and the usual stuff. No drunken noise from the street either.It was very quiet, very comfortable and I slept well.Normally I like to add pictures and more detail to reviews, but due to the length of stay (or lack of it) I can't this time- sorry!When I return to Seattle this will be up there at the top of the list of hotels to use. Give it a try!",5
398,398,"inn at the market-ok I stayed at the Inn at the Market this week, as I do about once each year on business. Its a great small hotel in a great location, terriffic restaurants and attentive staff. The rooms are however showing their age and need updating...as the finishes are warn. Spring for the bayside rooms because cityview is on a major transit route and the windows are not sound-proof",3
399,399,Great place! Nice Place. Service was great. Rooms were clean. I would stay here again.,4
400,400,Great Hotel!       Water and mountain view from room 410,4
401,401,"Inn at the Market We stayed at Inn at the Market for a long weekend and had a delightful experience. The staff was very helpful. We stayed on the 6th floor with a view of the Sound. By the little courtyard entrance was a great place for breakfast, Bacco. Also, two french restaurants, Campagne and Cafe Campagne. The Inn is within walking distance of many fine restaurants. The Market is just a short walk down the hill. It also features a nice patio overlooking the water. We will definitely stay there again.",5
402,402,Great Location       Nightime view of Seattle from Hotel,5
403,403,Perfect Stay! My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights while I was attending a conference. It was worth the walk to the conference center to stay at the Inn at the Market - we had an eighth floor room which was exceptionally quiet and comfortable. The location next to the Public Market is unparalled - we loved the easy access to street food and activity. Our experience was totally positive and I would not stay anywhere else in Seattle!,5
404,404,Loved the hot apple cider Enjoyed the hot apple cider on the first 2 nights in the lobby and missed it tremendously on the 3rd night. Good location next to the pike market. Front desk staff are friendly and try to be helpful.Room smelled of tobacco though it is supposed to be non-smoking room. 2 glasses in the bathroom were chipped or cracked! Quite unexpected for a highly rated hotel. Didn't find the bed all that special too...Didn't find the deck very fantastic....maybe coz it's winter and the winds were too strong to stay in the deck for long....Room-wise it is a very average 3 star. Hotel wise it has a great location next to the market but that's about it. Was expecting more for the high price....,2
405,405,"Okay, but not amazing My husband and I stayed here last weekend for one night. I had spent some time trying to find a great place to stay in Seattle. Read the tripadvisor reviews, saw that it was listed in TL Top 500 hotels, etc. Seemed like a pretty good bet it would be a fantastic place. It was great, fine...but just not really the amazing little boutique hotel I'd expected from the reviews and ratings. We thought the room was nice, but again, not incredible. The service could have been better too. The woman at the front desk was very friendly, but got a few things wrong. On another note -- if you are visiting Seattle, try to eat at Canlis. We had an incredible meal there!",3
406,406,"Not impressed by the Inn My husband and I thought this an attractive little hotel. Rooms were on the small side, but nicely furnished. The rooftop garden deck was a nice photo-op, but too breezy in Sept. for lounging. Also, getting service for a glass of wine was a major undertaking. We finally had to go to the bar next door, order it, then come back and wait for the bellboy to deliver it. Didn't need a hassle after a long flight! Would probably stay elsewhere next time. Perhaps the Fairmont.",3
407,407,"Nice botique hotel, awesome location, big room       Looking toward Elliot Bay from the fromt of the courtyard",4
408,408,Wish I were still here!!! Inn at the Market will be the first call I make when next planning a visit to Seattle. The location is absolutely perfect and the water view rooms are just that; water view with a nice glimpse of the mountains. The staff are very accommodating and the beds are ultra comfortable. I was impressed by how well-priced their mini-bar items were and glad to not have to pay $6.00 for a bottle of water. The Inn is a must for anyone wanting to see Seattle at its best!,5
409,409,Wouldn't Stay Anywhere Else My wife and I stayed at this hotel for three nights and enjoyed it thoroughly. The location is great - so close to all the shopping areas and literally next door to Pike's Market. Lots of great restaurants in the area and the staff is very helpful at recommending them. Our room overlooked the street below but wasn't noisy at all. There is plenty of space in the rooms for luggage and the bathroom is big and bright. Excellent mattress as well. We can't wait to go back.,5
410,410,The best hotel ever! We spent a long time researching hotels in downtown Seattle for our 25th wedding anniversary. We are so glad/thankful we selected The Inn At The Market! It was perfect. We had a beautiful room overlooking Puget Sound. (Deluxe water view-8th floor) We watched the ferries and boats go by our window. The hotel was extremely quiet - it was like we were the only guests. We were treated kindly. On our arrival they set out a card and special chocolates for our anniversary. I can't say enough - I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a very special place to stay. We plan to make this a yearly event - we had the best time!,5
411,411,great location A lovely hotel in a great location. The room was a good size and not too noisy even though it was on the town side. We enjoyed sitting on the terrace with a glass of wine. Just one point make sure that you check out in person. We did an express check out and then when we got our credit card bill found that they had charged us even though we had prepaid through Expedia. This was promptly sorted out but was inconvenient,4
412,412,"Boutique Charmer in Great Location My wife and myself recently spent 5 nights at the Inn at the Market while I attended a convention. We had a very nice time at this small, comfortably furnished hotel that has a great location just up the hill from Pike Place Market. The walk to the convention center is about 8 blocks east, pretty easy except for the steep 1/2 block adjacent to the hotel. There are a number of trendy restaurants as you walk north on First Ave. and Pioneer Square with its old stone buildings and charming pergola is south along the same road. And of course, the market is a 1/2 block to the west and has many food stands, boutiques, fish and flower stalls, handicrafts, jewelry tables, entertainers, and ethnic dining options that spill onto the narrow alleys and covered arcades. It was a pleasure to wake up in the morning and grab something to eat nearby while watching the small trucks and vans unload their wares and the vendors set up their tables.Our room was on the corner overlooking the city and was very spacious, with lots of storage space in the wardrobe and a large bathroom. The sink was a pedestal-type, so spreading out toiletries was limited to the glass shelf or nearby small table/shelf unit. We could hear traffic noise from the street, which was annoying, but we did request their lowest-priced room and it is in the city, so I wasn't expecting total silence when we closed the doors. The rooms have window seats with pillows, a nice feature that makes the rooms appear bigger and provides additional seating or a good spot for reading while people-watching. The decor is contemporary, with beiges, browns, and blacks predominating. In good weather, the upstairs terrace would be a nice place to sit and enjoy the views of the bay and the market.The modern, brick building surrounds a pleasant courtyard with a splashing fountain/sculpture adjacent to some outdoor seating for the hotel restaurant. The lobby opens off the courtyard and has a fireplace, stuffed chairs, and the registration desk, where the helpful staff operates.We enjoyed our time here. The hotel is a nice option for those who don't want a large convention hotel in a central Seattle location. Do be aware that Seattle does have its share of street people and that there are a couple of strip clubs near the front of Pike Place Market.",5
413,413,"Great views from terrace but only a brick wall from our window.... We stayed here for one night before heading off into the Cascade mountains. We arrived after 14 hours of travelling from the UK. Our room was very comfortable, not huge, but okay, whereas the bathroom was very spacious, enormous walk in shower, plenty of toiletries. We were very disappointed though when we opened the curtains and found our 'city view' was in fact a brick wall about 6 feet away. If we had been staying longer we would have asked to be moved, although we did ask when we checked in if any waterview rooms were available and were told no. It was very obvious though later in the evening when we were sitting on the terrace that only a few were occupied. We took other peoples advice and went up to the deck with a bottle of Champagne - (glasses from reception). The views and the spectacular sunset certainly made up for the brick wall outside our window! Beware - if you arrive on a Monday or Tuesday evening there is no room service. Not what you want to hear after a very long day and only airline food to sustain you. Also every restaurant in the immediate vicinity was closed - only place we could get a sandwich was a Deli round the corner.Position is great next to Pike Place Market but when we returned to Seattle after a few days, we stayed at the Marriott Waterfront. We actually preferred its location near the aquarium and cruise terminal, still only a couple of minutes from Pike Place.Not really any atmosphere compared to the Marriott.",3
414,414,"Perfectly Great! After much researching of hotel properties for our four-night stay in Seattle after a cruise to Alaska, I chose the IATM. It couldn't have been more perfect for our stay. It was right AT the market, close to all restaurants, shops, coffee shops etc. The room was quite small but staff accomodated our request for a high floor (8th). Clean and well maintained and the personnel were efficient and very polite. Repaired a running toilet within a very short time, after complaint. Deck on 5th floor overlooking Elliott Bay is a plus, to be outdoors and relaxing with a view in a large city is a nice touch. My concern was coming from sunny Florida, I planned for four rainy days in Seattle and wanted to be within proximity to everything, which we were. Were very lucky with sunshine most of the time. Hotel was great. Would be our choice next time!!!",5
415,415,"Pike Market next door The Inn at the Market was great hotel with the entrance tucked in an alley way. Beautiful rooms were large with a view of the harbor. We were right next door to Pike Market and a block from the waterfront where we took the Lock Cruise. Great cruise! Several restaurants and shops are near the hotel. We walked everywhere. I didn't realize there were so many hills in Seattle. The walk to Pioneer Square was only five blocks, but the homeless and decay in that area was a drawback. The Underground Tour was worth the walk! We caught a bus back to the hotel since they were free in the downtown area. We had to use valet parking for our car at $25 a night. Parking was too hard to find in that area. I thought that the rooms were overpriced too, but I guess hotels can overcharge in August.",4
416,416,"Good, but not as nice as it used to be We've stayed here many times over the past 5 years and have always had a great experience, but this trip showed the hotel is losing it's high rating. Their attention to detail (lack of maintenance) is showing. Carpets dirty, a disgusting strong perfume stench used by housekeeping to try and cover odors in the hallways. Smoking allowed in a non-smoking hotel. Many little details are being over looked. The location and view are still the best for hotels in this area but the room and maintenance are average at best. We will try other hotels over this one in the future - at 355.00 a night I was very disappointed!",3
417,417,"Great Hotel Just an excellent hotel. Great room, great staff, great location. Highly recommended. We'll stay here again and recommend it to our friends. For the price and location this has got to be the best deal in Seattle.",5
418,418,"Great Hotel, Great Location! I stayed here overnight for business and will come here again everytime I come to seattle. The lobby is very nice and modern. Service was prompt and courteous. The room was well decorated and clean. I liked the bathrobes and the chocolates waiting for me when I checked in. The best thing about this hotel though is the location. You are one block way from the market and great shopping. Even on a Wednesday morning it was bustling and teaming with life.",5
419,419,Great place to stay! Inn at the Market is a wonderful place to stay. We had a view of Elliott Bay which we so enjoyed!The hotel is located close to most of the main Seattle attractions - within walking distance.The staff was very helpful - they assisted at ever turn. We would stay here again!,5
420,420,Loved the Inn at the Market       view from our room,5
421,421,Loved the inn The Inn at the Market was awesome. You can not beat the location right at the market. The room was very large and the beds are really comfortable. Our room had a partial view of Elliot Bay. Don't miss the rooftop deck which has to have the best view in Seattle short of the Space Needle. The staff was very friendly. Highly recommended. We'll be staying there again in the future.,5
422,422,"Best hotel in Seattle My partner and I had a fantastic stay at the Inn at the Market hotel. The beds certainly lived up to their reputation, they were very welcome after our long flight from the UK. We were more than impressed by the efficient and friendly staff, and the comfortable clean rooms. You also can't ask for a better location, so close to Pike Place Markets. We would recommend the hotel to anyone, and would not stay anywhere else but Inn at the Market in Seattle. One word of warning, we would not recommend the Bacco cafe for breakfast, it was a complete rip off, you would be best to head down to the markets for something to eat.",4
423,423,"Couldn't have asked for a better hotel experience! Everything about this hotel is perfect. We stayed in a townhouse suite for two nights and wish we could have stayed a month. As soon as we walked in our room and opened the windows, we could see that we had a million dollar view! We could see both the skyline of the city as well as Pike's market (it's literally about 50 feet away), the water, and the mountains in the distance. The room was two levels with a kitchenette and living room downstairs and bedroom and bathroom upstairs. The bose radio was great - in fact we never even turned on the television! The beds were really comfortable, and the linens were top-notch. Okay, now on to the service: in one word, fantastic. It's extremely important to me to be greeted with a casual and genuine manner every time I enter or leave a hotel, with eye-contact.... sounds easy, but it's a rarity in today's hotel market. No matter when we came or went, we were always greeted with a smile and eye contact - I really love that. The staff was more than helpful and always went above and beyond the call of duty to ensure that we were well taken care of, that we knew about the great places to see and wonderful restaurants to dine at.Some hotels just don't get it, but Inn at the Market definitely understands that excellent service is what hospitality is all about. I'd much rather stay at a small, intimate property like this where I'm taken care of than in some monstrous hotel. Kudos to the staff and management for making this a fabulous hotel experience!!!",5
424,424,I did not want to leave!       Very comfortable bed!,5
425,425,"Mrs. Havesham moves to Seattle We last stayed at Inn at the Market, Seattle's boutique darling overlooking the Sound west of First Avenue, in 2001. At the time it seemed charming, luxurious, well-managed, and well-positioned to walk the downtown area. When we returned in June, 2006, we found the property in exactly the same state, down to the carpets and the paint job, only five years older. Like the dowager in Dickens' Great Expectations, this old dame hadn't moved in five years (OK, Mrs. Havesham didn't move in 20), and no amount of air spray could cover up the decay. The area around the hotel has likewise declined, such that a stroll towards Pioneer Square had all the patina of a Fellini film, replete with panhandlers, stoners, bikers, and guys with pants well below their plumber's line for ease of repulsive viewing.Restaurants in Pioneer Square appeared dirty and the famed Skid Row area has returned as a flexible homeless folks' hangout. Too bad a city as wealthy as Seattle can't cope with the needs of its least able. While I see a potential synergy between quarters for the homeless and the rooms at the Inn, I suspect the $500/night rates might prove a bit daunting.I continue to give stars for friendly, professional service, regardless of a property's physical condition, and the employees at the Inn are thoroughly helpful. But they can't take the cigar smokers off their own balcony, nor the drunk, nocturnally screaming frat boys from the adjacent streets. I hear the Four Seasons is opening a new hotel in the Fall....",3
426,426,"Stylish, comfortable, great location It was great to stay so close to the market, with all the shops, restaurants, and food purveyors in easy walking distance. The hotel was very stylishly decorated, and the lobby area had just been redone (still smelled slightly of paint). Our room was unexpectedly large, and so was the bathroom. It seemed a bit of a waste of space to have such a large bathroom but only have a regular size tub with in-tub shower (and the shower head was not on a hose, which I missed). Still, it was trendily decorated in the Pottery Barn style, and clean and quite comfortable. Our room overlooked the harbor, which was great and made it a bit quieter.The amenities, comfort, style, and location made it a great place to explore Seattle from. The staff could use some work in terms of turning this into a top-notch service hotel. Two examples: 1) The first night we arrived late (10pm) and asked about places we could get a bite to eat. First, the (young) man behind the desk recommended their own restaurant for desserts. I then asked if there were any nearby tapas places (and I pronounced it in correct Spanish tah-pahs rather than taa-paas). He just stared at me for a moment, then said there were a couple of places just down the street. Turns out, he was directing me to two strip clubs (he thought I said topless). I am a 46 year old woman, and was with my husband. Seems pretty unlikely that I would be asking about topless bars, and he must have thought that or he wouldn't have stared so. Didn't it occur to him to ask me to repeat myself, or to look puzzled and ask me to describe the type of place I was looking for? Inexperience, I guess. After wandering up and down the street, and seeing The Lusty Lady and Showgirls, but no tapas restaurants, my husband and I did get a big laugh. 2) There is no place to park near the hotel--you have to use their valet parking, where you drop your car off right in front of the hotel. The second night we were there, the street in front of the hotel was closed and we couldn't get to the valet area. We drove around for 15 minutes, trying to find a different way in. We finally had to move some police barriers on another street and sneak in to get in front of the hotel. The desk was apologetic, but shrugged it off. And it must happen regularly--in the morning it was clear that the street was closed due to bigger happenings at the market on a Saturday. How difficult would it have been for the hotel to move its little valet parking sign and the valets and have the guests drop their cars off at the corner, 30 feet away?These are minor glitches, but for $300+ a night, you expect a hotel to work these sorts of kinks out of the system. Other than that, we had a nice time.",4
427,427,"When can I come back??? We loved this hotel! It was cozy, not stuffy or snobbish at all, and the service was fantastic. You can feel it when you walk in the door. We had a great view, our room was beautiful and quite large with huge bay windows. This hotel has great ambiance and it is in the perfect location. Go to the market (next door!) and get some wine, meats and cheese. Ask for a bottle opener and glasses from the front desk. Now go out on the rooftop deck and watch the beautiful sunset. You will catch yourself trying to figure out a way to live at this hotel. And... what a bargain! In retrospect, I would have paid hundreds more. I can't believe this hotel isn't number one in Seattle.",5
428,428,"Nice, but needs some undating My husband and I stayed at the Inn at the Market to celebrate his birthday, and overall, our stay was wonderful. We enjoyed a two-story suite with an incredible view of the Market and Sound. It was quiet and the location was perfect for us. My only complaint would be that the hotel needs to do a better job at keeping up with maintainance. Our room had major scratches on several walls and a few too many stains on the carpets. There were also many cracks in the bathroom tile and other significant signs of wear in the bathroom. For the price, we expected much more in regards to quality and upkeep. Hopefully, management will pay more attention to keeping this lovely hotel fresh and lovely.",4
429,429,"Life Is Good My Daughter and I stayed at the Inn At The Market on April 24 after a four day trip to Vancouver BC. We arrived at midnight from Vancouver. (Hint-- the USA/Canadian boarder is a nightmare...we waited over three hours to get across, and were told a four to six hour wait on the weekend is not unusual.....make sure you leave either very early in the morning or late at night.) Greg the night front desk person, gave us an absolutely wonderful welcome.He upgraded us from a cityview room to a breath taking end-room on the 6th floor!!.We woke to the sounds and smells from the famous Pike Street Market....The location was incomparable! Good restaurants,great boutique shopping, and if you need mainstream...Macy's is three blocks away. I have stayed at the Monaco, and the Grand Hyatt in Seattle....I will never go back.....this is my new Hotel of choice.",5
430,430,"Great for Vacation, Less So for Business Travelers Inn at the Market offers a superb location near Seattle's Pike Place Market, as well as tranquil, well-appointed guest rooms. The hotel is steps from the excellent Campagne restaurant (pricey but worthwhile), the superb 94 Stewart Street (marvelous modern American fare with exceptional wine and cheese choices) and numerous other notable restaurant choices. There is excellent shopping nearby.I recommend Inn at the Market unreservedly for those on vacation in Seattle. The staff is friendly, the room is comfortable and restful, and the location cannot be improved upon. One small quibble: no lobby shop for sundries, and unfortunately the hotel is some distance from a drugstore.If you are a business traveler (as I was), I might send you elsewhere (perhaps to the Vintage Park, the Monaco, or the Olympic Four Seasons) for the following reasons:  (1)No desk with task lighting. Although there was a windowed table in my room, it did not have task lighting nearby. I had to order a flashlight to read paperwork while working on my computer at night. (2)Staff will not put Fed Ex charges on your room account. Yes, they will (after some idiscussion) charge your credit card for Fed Ex, but it would be easier to just have the charge added to your room, as most business-oriented hotels will do.Bottom line: lovely place for leisure travelers, but needs a few changes to be top-notch for those in Seattle for business purposes.",4
431,431,"Nice place! Just got back from a week in this nice City. Stayed at another, high end hotel the first three nights which was exceptional, but priced a bit high. The last two nights we stayed at the Inn. Excellent location, helpful employees, and very nice rooms. It is a very fair price for all of the reasons I just mentioned. The roof top patio was really very beautiful and worth it (if the weather is nice) all by itself. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel in fact if we go back in the future, this would be my first pick!",4
432,432,"the best location, still a bit overpriced We stayed at the Inn at the Market for a weekend getaway in Seattle. The hotel is nice, and the location cannot be beat, I challenge you to find a more centrally located place to stay in downtown Seattle. The rooms are above average, the bathrooms are huge and very nice. I must echo a previous negative review, however, and state that at this price range I'd expect a lot more. We paid $165 a night at the IATM, and only $200 at the Sheraton on a previous trip. While the Sheraton wasn't as centrally located as the IATM, you felt like you were staying in a $200/night hotel, it was very nice. A few things stand out at the IATM:1. Valet parking is very expensive at $25 a night. Expedia notes that there is a free parking option, that's apparently not correct. In fact, there's no alternative to valet parking at all unless you want to park in an outdoor, unsecure lot a block away.2. Ceiling lights out in our room that housekeeping didn't fix, even after pointing it out to them.3. Telephone didn't work, the only way you could get out was to dial 0.4. Television in our room was inexplicably located directly to the left of the bed. To watch TV required one to sit sideways on the bed or lay on your side.5. The foam posturpedic beds, which I hear a lot of people like, nearly paralyzed my wife with back pain. I guess the hotel can't be held responsible for this because I'm sure most people like them, but they should have other options for people that don't. We surely won't be buying one of those matresses any time soon.Overall, not a bad hotel, just a bit too much for what you get. I guess you pay a lot for the location, a bit too much in our opinion. We probably would not come back at this price.",3
433,433,"I will return I recently stayed at the Inn at the Market. I absolutely loved it!! I had never stayed in a hotel in Seattle so I did a ton of research. I knew I wanted to stay within walking distance of Pike's Place Market. This place was in the best location. The room was beautiful (we got the Deluxe Water View), the bed was incredibly comfortable. It was beautifully decorated and lots of attention was paid to detail. The staff was great. We will return!!",5
434,434,"Wonderful location, great beds, pretty rooms The Inn at the Market lived up to the positive reviews. As tourists without a car, the location couldn't have been better. There are countless excellent restaurants within easy walking distance. Although it was very rainy, we were able to explore the area and race back to the hotel to warm up when we got too wet or cold (we're from SoCal and have little tolerance for weather). The staff was always friendly, and the view from the deck was glorious even on a dark day. The room was spacious, and the beds extremely comfortable. The hotel made our stay in Seattle great fun even with uncooperative weather.",5
435,435,"Tempur-pedic beds! At the last minute (literally driving past it on way to another hotel) we decided to stay here. It was great! The staff were extremely helpful and accommodating, the room really comfortable and clean, and the location excellent. The atmosphere and location of this hotel made it a great choice (we had previously stayed at the Grand Hyatt which we were returning to). Our room was internal facing (last one left), and was a bit loud, but the tempur-pedic mattress was a huge bonus and fun to try! On our way to the 'hotel restaurant' (which is across the courtyard), the front desk staff suggested we try another one which turned out to be excellent. The view from the deck is great too. I'll stay here again!",5
436,436,Great central location       view from Lowell's Restaurant only 200 feet from the hotel,4
437,437,"Perfect place to stay The location is absolutely wonderful-right on the Market with a rooftop deck that we brought breakfast up to the first day we were there. We also watched the sunsets over the bay from the deck. The rooms were very nice, and we had no problem with noise from the very busy street below. Service was good and we walked to everthing in downtown Seattle without any problems. Service was good. One warning-valet parking is $25/night-not a huge surprise to those who travel to major cities but could be a jolt to a first time visitor.",5
438,438,Great Stay At The Market       Chile Heads' Delight,5
439,439,"Give Inn to the Market!! We ended back-to-back cruise vacations with an overnight stay at Inn at the Market. Although we had access to the Inn's sedan service (there are certain caveats that exist around that service attribute), we chose the quick cab from the cruise ship terminal to the Inn. My partner was having mobility problems and we advised the hotel in advance that we might be an early check-in. When we did check-in, the front desk rearranged our full waterview suite to a room that was close to being refreshed. We were able to get to our suite 608 with ease. The view was breathtaking with a grand view of the bustling marketplace and waterfront, the room well appointed and Gilcrest and Soame bathroom amenities were most welcome. It's always a good sign when there is little need to leave the comfort of a suite the first evening. At dusk we mingled with several other guests on the terrace, which lent itself to a nice little wind down to our vacation. The bed was extremely comfortable and made for a great night's rest. At checkout in the morning, one of the desk clerks who met us temporarily the previous day recalled both our names. We thouroughly enjoyed our stay and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, but it must absolutely be the waterfront view. It currently is our favorite accomodation experience.",5
440,440,"Great Hotel; Perfect Location This is a beautiful little hotel in an absolutely fantastic location. The hotel is right in the thick of Pike's Place Market and is also central to other interesting spots and sights across the city. Service was top notch--everyone on the staff was friendly and went out of their way to provide assistance. It can get noisy at night, so I recommend requesting a higher floor room. We did not have a water view room, but there is a deck available to all customers that provides stunning views of the bay and the surrounding areas. All things considered, I would not stay anywhere else in Seattle. The Fairmont might be more luxurious, but the location and atmosphere of the Inn at the Market (which is plenty luxurious) more than compensates.",5
441,441,"Great Location, but get a Water View room The hotel is nice, one of the best things it has going for it is the LOCATION. You are literally AT the Pike Place Market - well, just a 1/4 block walk from the hotel entrance. The staff is very accomodating, VERY friendly, greet everyone with a smile as soon as you enter. The room we had booked was a city view. I am not one to read reviews that say even though we booked a city view room, they automatically upgraded us to a water view and expect to get that treatment too (especially when it is $100+ a night extra!). Yes, we had booked the reservation 6 months in advance, but that doesn't mean anything either right?! I can say if you book a city view room, you WILL hear street noise most of the night - buses, car horns, people yelling from leaving nearby clubs, etc. The room was clean, the bathroom good size, well-stocked with towels, amenities, and the furniture in the room was heavy/good quality. The hotel is very convenient to many downtown areas, and shopping centers are in easy walking distance. The hotel arranged a Town-Car pickup to and from SEA-TAC airport, which was very convenient, professional, and reasonably-priced. For fun outside of downtown, hop on a Metro bus - for $1.25 (the bus fare outside of the Downtown Free area) go to the Seattle Museum of Flight and see the old Air Force One and also a Concorde jet on display!",4
442,442,"Disappointing My husband and I were looking forward to staying at a different hotel - especially this one. We expected a lot - and were so terribly disappointed.At this price point, the details you would expect are non existent. Requests went disregarded - newspapers, extra pillows. Water view that was promised didn't happen. Housekeeping slow and managed to lose a shirt (later returned), and bed linens came complete with holes throughout (were changed upon request). Our room was ok, but in desparate need of a paint job and carpet cleaning. The valet staff however was great - nice, friendly and helpful.We won't be back. The Inn's location is great, but nothing else was memorable. We'll go back to the Edgewater in the future.",1
443,443,"A wonderful Seattle hotel experience This was our second stay at the Inn and it was excellent both times. We were fortunate to have one of the rooms with its own rooftop deck (708) which added to the wonderful stay. Service varies from neutral to very friendly, the common areas and rooms are very clean, well-maintained and near luxury in furnishings. The location right near the Pike Place Market was perfect for us. It provided easy access through walking or brief cab rides to most primary sites. Getting to and from Safeco field for baseball games is somewhat difficult by cab but this is due to the poor access planning by the city not proximity to the hotel. There are excellent restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.This is a first class hotel which would be difficult to beat unless full-service luxury was what you wanted. The only complaint is that the rooms are not soundproof and the air-conditioning is somewhat noisy though very effective. These sound issues did not detract from our experience and we wouldn't book a room at any other hotel upon returning to the great city of Seattle.",5
444,444,"Worth every penny if you have the best rooms Three lovely nights there, the first two in a huge room. They had not promised a full water view, but we got one and hardly wanted to ever leave, since the waterfront was right below us, with ferries and ships coming in and out -- we even ate in our room one night, just to see the sunset, with the Olympic Range coming into view as the sun went down.It's very expensive by Seattle standards, but worth every penny if you have a room on the 8th or 7th floor looking over the water. In fact, two 7th floor rooms share a (semi) private deck -- right below our room, so we could see how much people enjoyed it.The attached restaurant is very good, too, but I wouldn't choose room service again -- the hotel bell staff delivers the meals and they are not as hot as they would be if the restaurant staff grabbed the meal just when it was ready (as they do at the Heathman, in Portland). The restaurant has an outstanding wine list, and there is also a cafe, one floor downhill, that looked like it had an excellent menu of country French food.The service was excellent throughout and the location can't be beat, with Pike Place just a block away. I do not reccomend the breakfasts, but since the small coffee bar that prepares them is apparently going to leave, things may be better in the future.And I don't think, except for location, the Inn would be quite worth the money if you didn't have a room with a good view. It would be comfortable but there are other hotels not too far away. It's one of the places where you want to spring for the very best the hotel can offer.",5
445,445,"Loved the Inn We stayed at the Inn at the Market from 7/11/05 thru 7/18/05. The location of the hotel is perfect for sightseeing and getting around Seattle without a car (you don't want to drive in Seattle). Pikes Market is across the street, the waterfront within steps, the Monorail to the Space Needle a short walk, and plenty of great places to eat within a short walk or cab ride. The service and conceirge staff at the Inn were terrific. Very helpful in recommending and arranging sightseeing excursions (Mt. Ranier, whale watching, vineyard tours,etc.). A complimentary town car is available for trips within the downtown area. This was a great help with dinner reservations. The rooms were immaculate. Twice a day room service included turn down in the evening with fresh towels. The decor of the rooms was modern and elegant. Don't miss the roof top garden area for a great view of Puget Sound. This was a great place to unwind at the end of the day with a bottle of wine. I would definetly return to the Inn.",5
446,446,"Best hotel experience in a long time! I visited the Inn at the Market for 3 nights on a business trip. Let's start with the Front Desk Staff; They were always helpful and personable...no attitude. They greeted every guest as soon as they walked in...great job!The room was great! It had everything I needed including wireless internet, which worked perfectly. I worked while watching the ferry boats go in and out of port.....very calming. The mattress was amazing, I wanted to walk out of the hotel with it but couldn't figure out how to get it out of the revolving door without anyone noticing. It was Tempur-Pedic...I know because I wrote it down. It was the most comfortable mattress I've ever been on. I woke up very early and walked right across the street to Pike Place Market to get breakfast and smell the fresh flowers that are set up each morning at around 8am. Everything about this place was truly what a hotel should be. I hope you enjoy it.",5
447,447,"Worth the Money for the Location We recently stayed at the Inn at The Market - returning after having stayed there in 1999. It is still the best location in seattle - particularly if you are there for shopping! The hotel is nice - the rooms are nicely furnished - but are not take your breath away rooms. Views are risky - but who goes to Seattle to sit in their room and watch the world go by??? The beds are tempurpedic and are incredible - you can count on a great night's sleep. As it was back in 1999, the staff are excellent. We had requested a room on the same floor as the terrace - and they met that request pleasantly. Too few guests take advantage of the terrace. For a nice evening go to one of the shops on Pine street, purchase a nice bottle of Washington State wine and some snacks and head back to the terrace to watch the ships leave and the sunset. Very relaxing and romantic. The staff will assist with wine glasses, etc. if needed.",4
448,448,"Wouldn't mind moving in I stayed at the Inn at the Market on May 20th. It was a treat for me. I just wanted to pamper myself a bit. It was to be a me only evening but when I saw the room I called up my boyfriend and suggested we reschedule our 'alone night'. The room, (the parlor suite) was just too awesome to not share with another person. I think it approached my 1bedroom apt. in size.  There were 2 tvs, 1 gigantic bed w/ a tempurpedic mattress, a couch, 2 nice chairs and the most fabulous chaise lounge. The lounge chair was positioned right in front of the huge picture window, and the view was amazing! I grabbed all the feather pillows from the bed and just ensconsed myself on the chair for the longest time, seriously, that view is better than a tv.  I really like the bathroom, it was large and sparkling clean with (except for a 2 person jacuzzi) the nicest tub I've ever been in. It had a comfortable slanted back and filled up really deep. It was a really great tub. I did find a white powder in the bottom of it before I filled it up, however the powder wasn't visible to the naked eye, so I don't really blame housekeeping, I just always check the bath before I fill it up. I appreciated that there was a lot of room in the refridgerator for things that I might want to put in there, while still having juices and sodas available for purchase (at a much more reasonable price than a lot of other places). They also had tasty nuts and candies for sale in the room that were a decent price and unusual. I don't know about anyone else but I get really tired of chain hotels trying to charge ridiculous prices for average products, it's annoying and I'm really glad this hotel wasn't like that. I had an excellent meal from room service, (the dinners are from Campagne which is a very nice French restaurant, I'm not sure where the breakfast is from, but I didn't have it). I had had a negative experience with Campagne about 12 years ago so I didn't really want to order from them but I did. I was so glad too! Nearly a month later and that dinner is still haunting me it was sooooo good!!!! I had halibut (which I don't normally even like) with a tomato coulis and frites. Those two weren't paired together on the menu but it's what I wanted. Had the creme brulee trio for dessert which was also quite good. I enjoyed the balcony, I wasn't there for much of the daytime but it would be a pleasant place to eat lunch. It was a very nice place for me to smoke at night (since there was nobody else around). This is the hotel I would reserve for a treasured out of town guest. It's exceptionally well located, nice staff, feels homey and that view can't be beat. BTW I didn't find it loud at all and I'm quite sure I slept with the windows open. It is pricey but if you can afford it than that won't bother you.",4
449,449,"This is the Best I recently stayed at the Inn at the market and it was outstanding. The service was perfect, the best I have ever encountered. I travel in some of the finest hotels in Europe and this beats them all. They always welcomed me when I came in and made sure I had everything I needed to have a comfortable and enjoyable stay. The rooms were so comfortable I did not want to leave. Our room overlooked Elliott Bay and each morning I would watch the ferry boats from the view of window. This was a treat because the weather was unusually perfect.I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Seattle.",5
450,450,"Wonderful!!! Contrary to what some of the other reviews have indicated, this is a wonderful little hotel. We live in the Seattle area and stayed at this hotel last night to try their Tempur-pedic beds (in all rooms). Wow! At least as wonderful as the beds were the staff members. We travel extensively and I told my husband that I think this was the most friendly staff we have ever encountered.You enter the hotel from a tiny little courtyard surrounded by shops and a couple of restaurants. A bit of tranquility amidst the busy Pike Place Market. The original Starbucks is right around the corner close to a wonderful bakery. Buy your breakfast goodies and return to the Fifth floor sun deck at the hotel. There you can sit, relax, munch on your breakfast while enjoying a full unobstructed view of the harbor. Can't get much better than that. Everything you want to see from Pike Place Market to the waterfront to the major downtown shopping areas and theaters are within walking distance from the hotel.The rooms are decorated very tastefully and are immaculate. Not one bit of grunge in the bathroom tile! I highly recommend this hotel!",5
451,451,"Be careful - water views We had planned a special get away for a number of couples and worked in advance to enusure the multiple rooms we booked had attractive water views. When we got there, 3/4 of the view was of the blank brick wall of the adjoinging building but they still considered and charged as a water view. When we requested something with a truely water view we were told thats all they had - take it or leave it. Disappointing service and attention - we would have strongly preferred accurate representations of what to expect even if it meant higher room rates. Buyer Beware!",2

I dropped in a TV remote to the front desk because the batteries had died and within moments of returning to my room, the mainenance guy was knocking on the door with a new one. Advice on places to dine/see in our spare time was impeccable. [BTW, the food's sensational in Seattle, try the Cafe Compagne adjacent to hotel for something really special.] Given I'd travelled half way around the world to attend a conference and meetings, my stay in Seattle was made even more special. I shall remember it always.",5

It was very loud and you constantly heard the sound of trucks and honking. The room was pretty, but no breakfast. No wine and cheese hour. Only coffee in the morning. I would stay at Inn at Harbor Steps where you get so much more for your money.",2

The rooms were very clean, quiet, comfortable and the bath robes a very nice touch. The staff very helpful. Location is great, very good restaurants within walking distance, the market is right there which is always fun to visit any time and free bus service is close by to visit the sites around the city. Beware, parking at the hotel is valet and costs $25.00 for the night. We mentioned to the front desk person that we were not made away of the cost and was not mentioned on the web page. I had expected to pay anyway, but they removed the charge. Great customer service. They also have a wonderful deck overlooking Puget Sound.

470,470,"Give and Take My boyfriend and I made a trip up to Seattle from Portland to check out the Deck the Halls Concert. I wanted to stay somewhere that wasn't a typical hotel, which is what I got with the Ace. I first wanted to book at this hotel because of the one in Portland, which I heard was stylish, unique, and the place to stay for twentysomethings. Second, upon seeing the website and learning that you shared a bathroom with the other guests if you have a standard room, I was in (because hey, I wanted a different hotel experience). Once my boyfriend and I arrived in the city (around 10 AM), we simply parked by the Ace and asked them where their paid parking was. The receptionist was incredibly helpful and told us we could check in early and take advantage of the parking lot right then (which was a huge relief since I hate dealing with parking). With the room, it was a bit smaller than I thought it would be, which irritated my boyfriend a bit. I thought the room was cute and since we were simply there to sleep, I had no problem with it. The bed was comfy and I found the bathrooms to be incredibly clean. As for the breakfast, I loved that it went until noon (because that meant my boyfriend and I could eat a little something upon checking in). I have to give another shout out to the receptionists because they were extremely helpful with directions. The one thing that got a bit on my nerves was the noise, which kept me up that night. At the same time, what can I expect when the hotel is located in a prime location and right alongside the main street? All in all, if you like a different hotel experience that somewhat resembles a dorm, then give the Ace a shot.",4
471,471,"Great Downtown Value I was pleasantly surprised with the Ace Hotel. Keep in mind that this hotel offers a completely different experience. The atmosphere was young, hip, and contemporary. Basic rooms do not have bathrooms, but do include a sink. Shared individual bathrooms down the hall are very clean and have great indie music piped in. Rooms have a minimalist style and include a bed, lcd tv, several hooks/hangers, and a paid snack station. Breakfast is complementary and included a waffle bar, granola, yogurt, juice, coffee, breads, and fruit. I would definitely stay here again. It was priced lower than most other hotels in the Pikes Place Market area of Seattle.",4
472,472,"Wouldn't recommend it. This Hotel looks great online. Although the price is right, it doesn't make up for the cleanliness. The shared washrooms were dirty, and most all the architectural details were very worn. I have stayed at much nicer places for the same price. I would not recommend this hotel.",2
473,473,"Cool Hotel We arrived at 8pm, the deluxe room we were given was small with no windows but a nice inside patio which was small but was an extension of our room and was somewhere to sit. We were tired after a flight from London so we just crashed. The following morning the manager asked us if we liked our room, we said we missed a window so he switched our room to a corner room which was a great improvement. We liked it and wanted to stay an extra night but the room had been requested so we checked out and went to the Hyatt for one night.The staff were friendly and the corner room we had was just fine, a little on the small side but the bathroom was big.I loved the style of the place, the staff and the location but the size of the rooms were the only gripe.I would stay there again but only for one night, and only if the room we had was a corner room with windows.",3
474,474,"Ace might not be the place My husband and I stayed at the Ace Hotel in Seattle for three nights and I was excited to book the room since the style of the hotel was far more up our alley than a floral BB or a Motel 6. We were happy with the first impressions. Our room was decent sized and bright on a corner with two windows (it鈥檚 one pictured on their website) and with a Shepard Fairey wall.  We asked the desk clerk about parking, since it does state on the website there is off street parking available. He wouldn't tell us anything more than 鈥渋f you got street parking stay there until 8am when they start charging.鈥?We couldn't get any lot info from him, so we drug our luggage to the room. Once we headed to bed things got worse. The bed size is not listed on the website and I assumed it would be queen. The beds are full sized which made sleeping comfortably a little difficult, but there wasn't much sleep happening in that room. The room was above a bar, with a loading/delivery zone on one corner and a bus stop on the other. The noise was staggering and continued all through the night and into the morning when we had to wake early to go feed the meter. Also the glowing light from the hall showing through the window above the door was annoying and I never saw it turned off. The next day we requested to move (and in fairness the rest of the staff we dealt with were very nice and accommodating) but we were unable to move until the following night because the hotel was full. On a plus side, the shared bathrooms were never an issue finding one free, and the breakfast did include coffee, tea, fresh waffles, toast, granola, juice, yogurt and apples. There are also piles of good magazines available for guests, and robes in the rooms to use. The second night I slept slightly better because I used earplugs (which I do not find an acceptable solution) and we did again have to wake early to deal with the car. The third night we were moved to a smaller interior room which was considerably quieter (we downed out the music we could still hear with the fan) and it was across the hall from the bathrooms. This room, without anything on the walls, definitely felt like a 鈥渘ice鈥?dorm room. However we did sleep better. All in all I would recommend this hotel if you are traveling alone or with friends and do not plan on doing much sleeping, or perhaps you have loud roommates who come home drunk and play loud music all the time. The location is good for walking to attractions like the space needle and the market, and we did find a few good restaurants nearby. I just don鈥檛 know if I would stay here again.",3
475,475,"Great staff, great location This was 'hip'. The rooms were fun, minimalist (i.e. lacking wardrobes), and spacious enough with large windows (we could just see the water). Things that I did not realise 'hip' would include:1. I did not realise that breakfast was included - fresh fruit and the waffle machine I love. 2. I was not expecting was that the staff would be so friendly and let us check in early with our ten tons of luggage and then leave it all day on the day we checked out so that we could continue to explore the city. Everyone was so nice. 3. The location too was fabulous - just at the edge of the free bus zone, and not far from the sculpture park, surrounded by fabulous restaurants.4. Shared bathrooms, 5 on the one floor we stayed on so never an issue getting into one for a shower in the morning and the showers were massive - could not reach from one side to the other.Do be aware that there is no lift (that I could find) and that the reception is up a rather large wide flight of steps off the main street - but the desk staff do help, which is lovely.",5
476,476,"trendy hipster Please no more hip hotels...hip has become a mask for all sorts of hotel evils - snotty disinterested service, minimalistic amenities, cold lack-luster style...not at the Ace! The service is great, the restaurant and coffee shop are major standouts (coffee shop was open at 6:30 am!!) the whole place is buzzing with style and life. Do request a front room with a view. If you have hipster phobias this is not for you. Best location in the city, easy walk to about anywhere.",5
477,477,"Glad I picked the Ace My husband and I spent four pleasant nights at the Ace. My husband and I were checking out Seattle for our future move to the area. I was a little wary because of some of the previous reviews, but I was totally pleased with my stay.The rooms are sparse, but just fine. It is aesthetic over function. My husband said the bed was uncomfortable, but I thought it was comfy. The mattress had a thick pad on top. I liked the wool blankets.The shared bathrooms were very clean. No need to bring soap, shampoo, or conditioner: it's provided. Plus they pipe nice music in!For breakfast they have a great waffle maker, plus granola, yogurt, toast, juice, and good coffee. Overall it was quiet, clean, pleasant, and fun.Okay, yes, the hallway lights are on until midnight and do shine into the window above your door. Seems a little silly. They should dim them at 10ish. And the younger people at the desk are uber-hip and unfamiliar with the nuances of hospitality- but they are all friendly enough. The exception was Ed (the manager, perhaps?) who was awesome. I asked him a million questions and he gave me great advice. They ask you to put a door hanger out requesting housekeeping service (instead of just doing it unasked), even though there is nowhere to hang your wet towels in your room. None of these were reasons to not stay here. Overall, it was a great deal for a room smack in the middle of Belltown. It was better than I expected.",4
478,478,"Loved it! Super location, wonderful staff, loved the style of the place, even our 8 year old daughter loved it - and that was even before they brought in the new waffle maker. It's small and cozy feeling even though it's all white. Interesting place... we'd definitely stay there again.",5
479,479,"reliably good stuff Have stayed at three different rooms here during 2 stays over the last year. Happy enough the first time to return for a second. The value is great if you can score a room with the view out to Elliot Bay. Just beautiful. You dont need any more than the minimal ACe white decor with a view like this. Also enjoyed room with large glass shower also (no view). On the last occasion, $160 is a bit much for a small room with no view or special shower features. On both visits, found staff very friendly and helpful. The location is central. Late nite pizza/beer joint across the street is key after a long night. Breakfast included adds to the pleasure.",4
480,480,"comfort and cool design       Facing bath, tv is behind me.",4
481,481,You pay the location The location is perfect because it is in walking distance from everything. There are a lot of stairs and if you have bags it is a problem no elevator available it is clean But it is noisy because of the woodden floors and you can hear the other rooms and the street. Breakfast included is good. Conclusion : good compromise,3

483,483,An ace hotel! A very reasonably priced hotel in a great location in Seattle. We spent two nights here and found the room and staff to be great. The communal showers were immaculate and we never had to queue. The breakfast was also great. There was a bit of street noise coming from below (we were on the first floor) but there were ear plugs in our room. I would also highly recommend the bar (Cyclops) below the hotel.,4
484,484,Wouldnt stay anywhere else!       The mirror,5
485,485,"Great feel....but not ideal. Very hip, very contemporary......very noisy!Great room (the revolving wall into the bathroom was fantastic!) but there's so much noise from the road outside....you really will be tempted to check if there's any glass in the windows.If you plan on being out until the wee hours every night (and need to get up early) this is the place for you.....if not I'd hesitate to recommend it.A pity because the location is spot on.",3
486,486,"Mice I was prepared to embrace the hipster, belltown aesthetic, but can't forgive $179/night plus a mouse in my room at 11:30 PM. Come on. Further, all they had to do at check out was ask how was everything, and I would have said, gee, you have a pretty cool hotel here, but you need to deal with the vermin. Alas, the uber-cool desk clerk couldn't be bothered to inquire about my comfort, so perhaps if I share this review, they might feel obliged to equip their guests with at least a mouse trap or two. Actually, could have been a baby rat now that I think about it. Best of luck Ace Hotel, I can't say that you will get me to stay with you again.",2
487,487,"Disappointed After arranging a much anticipated girl's weekend with a friend - and an escape from children...I was MORE than excited about sleeping through the night by myself. I may have children, but I still want to enjoy hip places and cool design etc...so, rather than stay at a boring run-of-the mill hotel - we opted for the Ace Hotel's digs. In order to ensure maximum uninterrupted sleep - we booked our own separate rooms. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were informed that the hotel was full and that there was a mix-up with our online reservation and that we only had one room with a small queen-sized bed (supposedly it was a deluxe room) in it. Normally I would suck it up, and accept that this was just a simple mistake - but this time I was really annoyed. My irritation was partially attributed to the overall nonchalant attitude of the uber-cool reception person - who didn't really attempt to compensate us beyond a slightly lower rate for the room. In fact, as she checked for our reservation on her computer she printed a sheet off and refused to let us look at it when my friend asked if she could see it - wanting to cross-reference the information on the sheet against what we had written on our reservation. It was strange, so much so that it appeared as though the mistake had been made on their part - but they didn't want to admit to it, and were quick to blame the online booking system. There was almost an inference that somehow it was our fault for booking online. To add insult to injury, we were also told after shelling out a small fortune for parking at a lot across the street, that we could have had our parking at a reduced rate at another lot - not easily marked. Once in the room, we found it dingy and not as charming as the photos on their web-site would suggest. However, we did see a couple of other rooms when we were walking down the corridors, that looked a lot better than our room did.Anyway, aside from being a great location and decently priced - it was the overall experience that just wasn't impressive. A few days later I received an email from the hotel thanking me for staying with them etc...we hope you enjoyed your stay with us...etc... and I responded with an email outlining my frustrations with our accomodation. This is not like me - but this time around, I really needed to air my dissatisfaction. The hotel's manager replied with an apologetic email and offered a discount on a later night's stay - to be redeemed by May 1st, 2008. This seemed like a positive response to our negative experience and I planned to return to the hotel with my husband for a romantic get away. Well, the so-called compensatory offer was never acknowledged. In my multiple attempts to contact the manager with a specific date and weekend in my messages - NOTHING. He did not return my messages. So much for that! I don't know what happened, as there was no reply at all. I guess the hotel doesn't need my business!Anyway, perhaps my experience was an isolated case. In any event, I will not be planning another stay at the Ace any time soon.",2
488,488,"Great value and location We stayed at the Ace Hotel three nights (a Thursday through Sunday). For the price, the location is impossible to beat. We stayed in room 107, a corner room on the front with two windows. I only have two complaints about the room: it was noisy at night (the room was directly over a bar) and my husband's and my feet hung off the end of the bed. However, the room was otherwise quite comfortable, the atmosphere was modern and fun, breakfast was good (granola, yogurt, toast, coffee and juice), and as I said before, the location was fantastic. The shared bathrooms were clean and convenient. At this price, I would definitely stay at the Ace Hotel again.",4
489,489,"Cool, but not quite right Great idea, but not such a great execution. I had a private room with a really cool hidden door to bathroom, but short cuts were clearly taken. Shower not the cleanest, bed not comfortable at all. My room had no access to natural light, but found out at end of stay I could have asked for another room. Would highly suggest rooms with shared baths instead.",3

492,492,"Fun Little Hotel in Belltown We stayed at the Ace Hotel in Seattle for just one night, and it was exactly what we needed. We found it to be a modern, chic little hotel with clean accomodations and a friendly staff. The manager, Ed, was great! He watched our bags for us while we explored Belltown, and at one point came running after me to bring me the camera I had left behind. Such courtesy! I'd definitely stay there again.",5
493,493,Perfect for young travellers. A very nice clean place. Stayed in a room with shared bath for 2 nights. Parking lot is two blocks away from the hotel by daily rate (you need to obtain a parking pass from the hotel). Convenience location and close to bus stop (about 5-10 mins). Take only 10-15 mins bus to Capitol Hill. The only bad things were that there was loud noise at night as our room is facing the street (we stayed there on a Friday and Saturday night). All and all it was a nice stay.,4
494,494,"The Ace Hotel is Awesome! We stayed in Seattle at the Ace Hotel for 5 days and we loved it. It is in a great location in Belltown, directly opposite the Macrina Bakery, which is quite possibly the best breakfast/brunch/lunch place in Seattle, wtih fabulous baked goods.All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Upon check-in, the friendly receptionist (whose name I forgot to ask...sorry!) gave us 4 fabulous food recommendations in the city, all of which we tried and loved. Being the foodies that we are, it's extemely important to us that we get good recommendations from the locals.The room was small, but totally adequate and the shared bathrooms and shower rooms were spotlessly clean. We enjoyed the simplicity of the hotel and the little extra touches, like the adjustable lighting, music in the bathrooms, and all the free, current magazines available in the lobby. The breakfast granola was really yummy, too.For the location, the amenities, and the price, I'd say the Ace is hard to beat.",5
495,495,"Very CUTE, WARM  OMG! At the last minute my husband and I decided to take a last minute, spontaneous trip for a conference in the state of Washington. The service of the staff, especially the manager made the trip for us both! I flew from Hawaiii and my husband flew in from Michigan. I arrived early and tired to the hotel, but I was accomodated immediately with a lovely room. In the first room we stayed at there was a glass shower behind the bed. How wild is that? Then we were upgraded into another chic room that had a revolving bathroom door with a mirror on it. My husband thought it was the coolest thing and would like to build one in our house. The complimentary breakfast and the mint scented amenities were nice to have. The ambiance of the place was so warm and cozy. The manager gave us a list of great places to dine at and visit and we enjoyed them all! Truly, it was the warm and kind service that made me feel at home and welcomed to the beautiful state of Washington. I strongly recommend giving the manager a raise! Thank you for having us. We look forward to making a trip back!",5

497,497,"feel good Me and my wife try to stay there every February and love it, you get to meet alot of cool people at breakfast and there is a certain amount of commraderie that comes with community bathrooms, and please remember that ALL hotel bathrooms are community bathrooms. Breakfast was refreshing ( doesn't weigh you down all day ) and it is close to everything, bars and nightlife are all within walking distance and the staff had good suggestions. This is not for everyone but if you are cool and like other cool people and don't mind sharing or interacting with other humans than this is the place for you",5
498,498,"Best value for money in Seattle A friend raved about this hotel, and i wasn't disappointed. Very modern, clean, crisp well thought out design (loved the blown up photos on the walls), fairly basic in terms of food (shared, help-yourself kitchen in the basement) - but for the price couldn't have asked for any more. Great location, close to Pike Place Market, and very friendly and helpful staff. Would definitely stay there again and again.",4

500,500,"Great staff, good value I've stayed at the Ace probably 6 times over the past six years. It's in one of my favorite (and incredibly convenient) neighborhoods. There's tons of stuff to do, places to eat, and great shopping all in close walking distance.The staff this time was definitely better than before. The first couple times I stayed there (in 2001 and early 2002), the staff was really aloof and way too into the fact that they were working in a nicely designed, young, trendy hotel. But now every single staff person I encountered was super friendly, helpful, and cheery. That makes it an even better place to stay!Yes, the rooms are spare, a little chilly, and they don't have huge flatscreens in them. But if you just want an inexpensive, clean, centrally located place to crash, this is a great place. If you're looking for a plush bed, romantic surroundings, and room service, this isn't your place.",5
501,501,"Ace Breakfast and the staff are great! I arrived in Seattle one rainy September evening without a place to stay, thumbing through the local directory at the airport I found a BB which sounded nice, (can't remember the name). Anyway I called they were fully booked but recommended the Ace. Im so glad they did, although they had no rooms for Saturday night they were free from Sunday but advised me not to reserve a room as they had 4 left and I would have to pay a booking fee if i pre-booked.I was pleasantly surpised to find the hotel about half the price of the stand chain hotels which were a bit more central. As someone has written this isn't a place for your mum and dad but as long as you dont mind sharing a bathroom, which are spotless clean by the way. This is the palce for you, staff couldn't be more friendly recommending places to eat and things to do a little off the beaten track.Breakfast was great and lots of it and unusually for hotels in Seattle was included. I've already recommended it to 3 of my friends.",4
502,502,Nice hotel with a European feel Ace was a very nice clean place and the staff was absolutley fabulous. The location was great and so was the continental breakfast. The only bad things were that our room had no AC so it was hot and there was a lot of road noise and we used earplugs. All and all it was a nice stay and I would stay again but def not the best ever,3

The location is great - right in the heart of Belltown and really only a couple of blocks from Pike market.The staff was friendly and helpfull the rooms were clean and efficent. They are going for a very minimalist modern thing so it is simple and austeer. We also got a room with a bathroom across the hall, there were many of them they were spaious and clean.My only complaint was the beds. The beds themselfs were lumpy and uncomfortable and the linens were scratchy.Otherwise a good experience.",3
504,504,"Ace Hotel is Aces The Ace Hotel is a stylish, no-frills, sparkling clean place to sleep. It's a short walk to the Seattle Art Museum and Pikes Place Market, as well as many fine eatries. I had an inside room (quiet) with shared bathroom and found it perfect for my short stay in Seattle, but be warned that the Ace has a lot of stairs and no elevator. Also the showers in the shared bathrooms, fully tiled, generous in proportion and clean as a whistle, have no grab bars or safety mats. That said, I love this place and wish there were Ace hotels everywhere I travel.",5

506,506,"Perfect in every way. We stayed at the Ace in Seattle for a short time in August. It is the PERFECT hotel. All the things you need, and none of the things that you don't. Great design, super comfy, great location. The staff were so friendly, knew all the cool places to go and were so helpful in every other way. The rooms are super stylie, have great art and all the ammenities that you really need. All in all, we LOVED this place and are planning to make a sepcial trip to Portland to check out the Ace Portland (apparently, they have turntables in all the rooms, and a library of vinyl you can check out).",5
507,507,"Great Affordable Stay! My boyfriend and I stayed here this past weekend in a standard with shared bathrooms and actually found it quite suitable. The early complaints about the windows not having any privacy have been resolved; they've added shades to the windows. The weather was mild so we didn't get a chance to try out the heating, but the air conditioning works well. As far as the noise goes, we stayed in a room 114 and slept fine--but even if noise is a concern, they provide ear plugs for your convenience.The room does come with a Kama Sutra book and condoms, laid ever so complacently by the bed. The room came equipped with a sink, a mirror above it that tells you you're beautiful, a hand soap dispenser, a vanity bar area with a tall mirror, a small desk with a small TV and an alarm clock, 5 hangers, 2 of which were occupied with bath robes, and towels. There's also a very modest snack bar (basically snacks inside a drawer) that you could grab for a price.The bathrooms were clean and come with a heater. Music plays softly through the speakers in the bathroom too. We stayed across the hall from the bathrooms so that was quite convenient for us.The kitchen/lounge area has an HD TV, serves Teaosophy tea and coffee, has a vending machine with very interesting items in there (i.e. Korean Pocky, popcorn, a deck of cards, caffine gum, hangover drink mix, and the standard potato chip fare, just to name a few), a drink machine next to it that has Aranciata (but we have NO idea how the vending itself works! There are no coin slots or buttons ...), and of course ice. Continental breakfast was great--includes milk, soy milk, OJ, granola, toast, and fruit. Light, healthy but quality selection.The staff was very friendly and helpful; we'd asked so much of them (i.e. storing the salmon we'd bought in their fridge, holding our luggage while we went sightseeing on the last day, calling us a cab late at night ... and more!) and they were very willing to accommodate accordingly. Overall, our stay was pleasant. The only complaint I could muster up was that the room was stuffy when the AC wasn't turned on, but that's quite minor. Yes, the mattress isn't memory foam or soft for that matter, and yes the blankets are coarse and Army surplus blankets, but quite honestly, for a place considered a 2 star hotel and for a 99 dollar a night stay, I wasn't expecting down comforters and memory foam mattresses (and am glad they don't have it as I am allergic to down), and I don't think anyone else should either. I'd choose this over the shabby, impersonal one star motels any day. We definitely would consider this hotel the next time we visit.",5
508,508,"The Ace: Not Just for the Young We have just returned from rainy Seattle, staying at the Ace Hotel in the Belltown area of the city. My husband and I were among the oldest guests of the hotel, by several years, but we never felt uncomfortable or unwelcome. Justin was so helpful when I called BEFORE our stay, recommending Dollar rental cars as they not only give discounts to Ace guests but also waive the fee for returning the car to the airport instead of the pickup site. (Both John and Jessica at Dollar were extremely nice too!).This arrangement allowed us to travel down to family in Gig Harbor and then use the car to return to the airport the next day. Justin also informed us that we would most likely have to change rooms on the last night of our 3 night stay, due to a snafu with our hotel.com reservation. Once at the Ace, we were warmly welcomed by Jibriil who showed us our room on the lower level. I was a bit surprised as Hotels.com had guaranteed a king size bed and we had a double. I asked Jabriil about the mixup (never having booked through hotels.com before) and he explained that there must have been an overlap in the booking. The room and bed were comfortable and a decent size with a large clean bathroom. I'm not that high maintenance, but do like to read at night, but there was no reading lamp in the room, just overhead recessed lighting. Jabriil came to my rescue with a small reading lamp and extra pillows. All were clean-pillows obviously sprayed with lysol between uses-but no biggie. The only thing missing in that room was a place to hang clothes and a couple more hangers. On the last night we did indeed have to move to a smaller room. Same size bed, smaller bathroom-a bit noisier as it was next to the stairwell. Still, we were quite comfortable and slept well. So the plusses: Justin and Jibriil-definitely they are the nicest guys, unpretentious , friendly, helpful. The location in Belltown is in the heart of all the under 30 hipness, but we over 30's , un-inked, non-smokers did not feel too out of place! The minuses: booking through hotels.com (I'm not sure the price of the rooms through them were the same as if we had booked directly through the hotel) and having to switch rooms. We would stay here again, but next time book directly through the hotel and request the rooms with larger beds. Still, it truly is the people who make the difference. Kudos to the staff at the Ace!",4
509,509,Ace hotel was brilliant!       bedroom....excuse the mess!,5
510,510,"Great Hotel The Ace is a very cool, centrally located hotel with an awesome staff. My wife and I stayed here in late June and early July and were definitely impressed. First, the location is awesome. It is located in the heart of Belltown, near great music clubs, Pike Place, downtown, and Capitol Hill. You couldn't ask for a better location, especially for those of us who like to walk and use public transportation. Note: the bus is free in the downtown area, only a couple blocks away. Also, the staff is great and provide a real local aspect to it all. We regularly asked questions on bus routes, good music venues, recommendations for local eateries, etc. We always got a very friendly response with good tips. The rooms are very clean, as are the bathrooms. All of this for less than a $100 bucks a night is a bargain. I definitely recommend the Ace for travelers who like a unique, cheap urban hotel with cool staff and design.",5
511,511,"Good Value and Location I contacted the property directly for my reservation. Staff was pleasant and helpful, our room was small but clean and quiet. Yes, there were condoms in the room, a candle, and a Kama Sutra book but we didn't mind. Bed was comfortable and there was a sink area as well as a desk. Free wireless was available which was great! A member of my family also has asthma but suffered no effects of mold while staying here (didn't see any in our room either). We opted for the shared bathroom and they were always clean and available. There was heat lamp in the bathroom which was nice when drying off and soft jazz music playing in the bathroom which I found nice. My family and I stayed here (2 of us w/a 4 yr old) and the hotel was a perfect base for sightseeing-in Belltown, blocks from Pike Market, the Waterfront and the Space Needle. Don't stay here if you don't like walking! Also, if you are taking the Victoria Clipper, Pier 69 is a short walk down the hill which was convenient. One downside was there is no stairs at the entry and they are a little steep if you have luggage. The person at the front desk hurried down right away to help us up with luggage. The self-serve light breakfast in the morning was good: juice, yogurt, granola, toast, coffee or tea which was served in lounge area downstairs where you could also watch a shared t.v. We loved our stay here and would stay again..",5
512,512,"Not bad Overall I think the hotel is nice. It was ok for me as a single traveler. I did not care for the minimalist decor, lack of air conditioning, and lack of window screen. The website does not specifiy that there is only a/c in the rooms with bathrooms, so that is misleading. But I had a travel fan and kept the window open and it was fine. They turned off the hall light at 10pm, but this may be a bit late for east coast travelers like me. It is bright in the room until the hall light is turned off, but I'm sure they would turn it of earlier if asked. Good things-- The staff is super friendly and helpful. They carried my luggage up the stairs and back down again when I left. The beakfast is great and the setup is nice. The breakfast room has milk, orange juice, toast and jam, yogurt, granola and fruit. There are also trays so you can take it back to your room and a flat screen tv to watch. The bed and pillows were very comftorable and I really liked the bathrooms and the mint shampoo/conditioner. If I was traveling alone I would consider the Ace again. If they added some color to the decor it would be nicer I think.",4
513,513,"Yuck. When we arrived, we climbed the flight of stairs with 100 plus lbs of luggage. We got to the top, checked in and were placed in the room at the very end of the hall. The walkways are lined with brown outdoor style carpet. We arrived in our room and even though the hotel is smoke-free, I began wheezing from the mold. The outer rooms are exposed brick and apparently ours was allowing moisture into the room. We checked the bathroom and it also had black mold growing in the 1x1 tiles. I went to the front desk and asked the gentleman if there was some way to check on a refund due to health concerns regarding my asthma and my inability to stay in the room. He said I had to check with Hotels.com since I prepaid and booked through them. Fair enough. He was helpful in saying that he would make a note in his computer system for verification of reasons we couldnt stay, not sure if this actually occured but we will see. Staff seemed pleasant but not very proactive in resolving problems. He didnt offer to have us check another room or to investigate our concerns with the original room.",1
514,514,"Very hip and friendly place I stayed in a room with two queen beds and private bathrooms. The room was very large and bright with great decor, all white paint and then grey army blankets covering the white beds, looked very cool, and a long mirror along one wall, and window seats covered with white leather. Free wireless internet and a CD player. Very large bathroom, kept clean. Laundry and self service breakfast with toast and cereal and coffee and fruit. Very friendly and helpful staff, who gave us good restaurant and museum recommendations, and carried our bags down for us. A really cool place to stay in the hippest part of Seattle.",5

516,516,"Interesting comfortable base in Seattle Really enjoyed my time here. Interesting decor with unique touches everywhere. Was super clean and tidy, bathrooms (although shared) were spacious, very clean and always available. The breakfast was more than adequate, fresh and simple and quite healthy, which is a nice change from the usual cardiac inducing breakfast fare served at most hotels. Would definitely stay again.",4
517,517,"Great hotel for a non-traditional stay and true feel of Seattle! I actually stayed at the Ace 2 new years eve's ago, and live in Seattle. I've popped in on occasion to make sure they're still the same, as I always route friends and people visiting Seattle to the Ace.It's downtown, on a busy street (1st ave) and rooms on the interior have no view.But the rooms are funky modern, and if you get a room with 'shared bath', then they give you bath robes and it's just fun! You have to be OK with shared baths and a little noise (ask for a room facing the side street or back of the hotel).Otherwise, you are in the best neighborhood of seattle- accessible to seattle center, tons of great bars and restaurants (for casual try belltown pizza and cyclops- they'll surprise you with great food and very stiff drinks!, for a nicer meal out try Zoe, and for breakfast you MUST walk across the street to Macrina bakery for a morning glory or rocket muffin- all food places are within 5 blocks of the Ace Hotel), fish market/pike place, the waterfront, downtown shopping, etc. You are also only a couple blocks from the 'free ride zone' on the buses to get you anywhere you want to go downtown.If you want standard, this is not your place. If you want to experience seattle, and are willing to roll with the punches and want a little more adventure, Ace Hotel will fit you perfectly. And you cant beat the price for downtown seattle!!",5
518,518,"I just read some terrible comments and was really shocked. I really stayed here about 8 months ago, but when I noticed all the horrible comments I just had to make my own. The concensus seems that if you're over 40 you most likely won't like this place. It's a different type of hotel, complete with condoms and kama sutra books. So anyone that's very religious might not find this too humorous, while others will think it's hilarious (as did I). Even the art on the walls weren't your typical boring hotel feel. I actually took pictures of this room because I loved it so much. Plus, the most fantastic part about my stay here (besides the great shampoo/conditioner and how the bathroom was designed in general) was the free breakfast! It wasn't your standard old banana with some concentrated OJ. It was make your own parfait, with fresh OJ and even Soy Milk. This is definitely for a certain type of crowd. And people that want something more luxurious shouldn't stay here. People that appreciate a cleaner more modern style should. Plus, it's located in Belltown, which is in walkable distance to Pike Place Market (where they throw the fish) and the Space Needle. Side note: They bought their cool Swiss blankets at the Army Navy Surplus store, which is right down the block from the hotel. Another side note: Macrina Bakery is considered one of the best breakfast/pastry places to eat in Seattle, which is right across the street from the hotel. Hope this steers people in the right direction.",5
519,519,"Ace hotel. More like a 7 of clubs. Currently staying at the Ace Hotel on business, since other hotels downtown are booked. The hotel is decent, but more like a 2 star based on my experiences. Overall my experience has been just ok. The room is a deluxe room according to the hotel, which isn't very deluxe-it just means I get to avoid sharing a bathroom. So here's my summary:Pros:Location-Plenty of bars and restaurants to choose from. Convinience store across the street. And an easy walk to downtown about 10 minutes. For those who don't want to walk, there's a bus stop right outside the hotel with frequent service. If you walk a block or two further closer to downtown, you'll be within the free ride zone to save yourself a 1.25/1.50 at rush hour.Wireless Intenet includedThe hotel is clean.Small continental breakfast included featuring toast, granola cereal and juice included in price.Cons:No elevator at the entry, so you have to climb a decent flight of stairs to the reception area. Not a big deal for the young, but could be a hassle if you've got heavy luggage.Receptionists seem friendly enough, but you can tell this is part-time work for them, and they don't seem to be all that interested in the comings and goings of people. I've walked past them numerous times at all hours of the night without so much as a look up to see who is coming into the hotel, or to give a simple greeting.Rooms are small, just enough for a bed, and a tiny desk and chair. And I'm in the deluxe. Decor is trying to be boutique-y, but to me it just looks like a sanatorium. Walls in the hallways and rooms are all white. There is no closet or drawers to speak of, so your luggage and clothes are on the floor in an already small room. You do have metal hangars hanging from a coat hanger on the wall which you can hear clanking at night and in the morning from the adjacent room. Bathroom is ok size, but looks cheap, with only a stand-up shower and toilet with open u-faced seating like in an airport or store, which isn't a big deal except that the towel holder is placed right above it, and to get a folded, stacked, and jammed in there towel out, it's easy to pull out the rest of them which fall into the toilet--not real smart thinking Ace. Naked lightbulb serves as the lighting for the room, which adds to the hostel/sanitorium/potential flophouse hotel effect. And the clincher is tv on a wall arm extending from the ceiling. There's nothing like a tv attached to the wall/ceiling to give you that motel feeling.Also, you have to leave a service room tag on your door when you leave, or they will not do housekeeping. They try and sell it as leaving you alone, but I think it's more about saving money.Summation: For location, and due to the few options available in this price range, this hotel is a decent option. But to call it a boutique hotel experience and charge a discounted corporate rate of 160 a night for a plain room that measures 15X15 in Seattle? That's definitely not aces.",2
520,520,"Great place to stay in Seattle Great hotel. The rooms are really fun - not huge but certainly different and comfortable. We stayed in a room with a shared bathroom but we never had to queue for one of them, even in the mornings - in fact, we could take our pick and they are palatious and clean. Don't worry about the noise either - our room was literally right over the Cyclops bar and if you have the window open it's noisy but as soon as you shut the window it's pretty quiet. Great location too - right in Belltown so loads of bars and restaurants nearby, 10 mins walk from the Space Needle and in the other direction, 10 minutes walk from downtown. Great value place to stay in Seattle, maybe not a place for the over 40s though.",4
521,521,"An Ace Stay We chose Ace Hotel from a directory found at a deserted stand at the airport because it appeared to be close to the Clipper terminal. It is! Had to give credit card details over the phone when making reservation/enquiry so was committed. Somewhat apprehensive on entering building and again on entering room. We are the parents another reviewer alluded to and were amused by some of the items supplied along with tea and coffee.However,the reception,the room- we were kindly upgraded, I think, in deference to our age,the breakfasts,the cleanliness, the friendliness of staff, the location and convenience all contributed to a great couple of days despite the rain.Ace has no control over the weather. Yes we would stay again- the Clipper service on 14th Jan- that's another story!",4

524,524,"Have an open mind? You'll enjoy the Ace Hotel I was originally attracted to the Ace by the price (of course). I'll also admit the hype surrounding the Ace Hotel made me curious. I found both positive and negative hype across the internet, and booked the Ace with an open mind. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the rooms and staff and overall value.If you've stayed at pensions in Europe and liked them, you'll be at home at the Ace. When I arrived I asked to upgrade from my single to a room with a washroom attached, imagining the worst about the Ace's communal washrooms. I needn't have worried. The ratio between rooms and washrooms is small. The washrooms are clean with a focus on white-tiled functionality.The room itself was small but I didn't feel I needed more. In relatively tiny area the Ace manages to fit in a comfortable bed, retro TV, desk and a stainless steel sink, all in an undeniably cool style. More than enough without feeling cramped.The staff was polite and interested, and offered well considered suggestions for food and entertainment. With perks like free Wi-Fi (a bit slow), free breakfast and parking, the Ace is a deal.That being said, if you are at all finicky about the hotels you stay at, the Ace may not be for you. Upon first entering the Ace you are overwhelmed by stairs reaching out of sight; note there is no elevator for your heavy luggage. The Ace sits above the Cyclops bar, a hangout for Gen Y hipsters. The music, chatter and cigarette smoke will filter up to your room. But that's all part of the vibrant area of Belltown that the Ace is in.Stay away if you're very particular about your room for the night. Stay at the Ace if you want value, location and style.",4

526,526,"Not as bad as some make it out to be After making my reservation, I hesistated a little because there were lots of very opposite reviews for this hotel. A lot hated it. A lot really liked it.I have to say this is a nice hotel. It is very clean, the shared showers are clean, spacious, and even equipped with stereo speakers. The staff were laid-back, helpful, and prompt.We had a double room, with no shower, and I have to say the only complaints I had were the noise from the street (Belltown is a very busy place - apparently lots of firetrucks), and a too-firm bed (sore back). Otherwise, I liked all the little extras - the bathrobes, decor, nice TV. The location is ideal, we paid for parking nearby, and hopped on the bus or walked everywhere we went.This is not a hotel for the picky, elderly or those who like to be pampered. I admit, it is sort of like a hostel, you get the basics. We paid far less than any other decent hotel in Seattle, so I feel like I got what I paid for.Overall, it wasn't bad at all.",3
527,527,"Above attractive staff, cute rooms, nice locale... Was a bit sketchy about reserving a room here when I viewed the reviews of the Ace here on the website - but I did it anyway. I am glad I did.When Iarrived, the very handsome, very approachable and did I say handsome (?) Doug checked me into the hotel. He recommended places to eat, how to get around and where to find parking. He then offered to send beer to my room with ice. Not necessary at all. And wow, he was very handsome... My room was 117 - one of the rooms on it's website. Yes, the mattress was firm (I believe it was actually a futon mattress) laid upon a block set above the floor. The room was clean, complete with Kama Sutra and condoms... Only downfall was the television was broken but when the staff was notified, a brand new one was installed in the room.The shared bathrooms were always clean, secure, and I felt comfortable using them at any hour of the night. The housekeeping staff, although not always easy to understand *primary language was Spanish, I believe* always had a smile on their faces and were cheery in the morning downstairs in the breakfast area. (A continental breakfast is included... just loved watching my fellow hotel mates wobble down the stairs hungover.)I will definitely stay here again when I come to Seattle... hope Doug is there. ;)",4
528,528,"Stay clear! We made an internet reservation for a Friday, then rang an hour later to add Thursday to the booking. On Thursday, we rang to let them know we'd be arriving late, they said no problem. We arrive at 10.30pm to hear: Oh, we don't have your booking for tonight. We don't have a room for you. Total apathy, not concerned at all. Says a few sorrys, looks at the reservation book, more sorrys, more apathy. Finally says, There's a BB next door then calls someone in authority, hangs up and says sorry several more times. Incompetence all around from management to employees. Completely soured our trip. STAY AWAY!",1
529,529,"Expect the worst A change of plans had us cancel our stay at the Ace Hotel. When we called to cancel - a week before our cancelled trip, we got a cancellation number. A month later, $240.57 (Canadian) had been charged on our credit card but we have since trashed the cancellation record. Given, we should have kept the number but the manager had been unhelpful, unsympathetic and snobby! Shame on them for being in the service industry. For $240.57, they have lost not only my business, but also of my colleagues and friends.",1
530,530,"Bad Service Bad Room Bad Kharma Generally i'm not a picky traveller, and i've stayed at the ace several times in the past 2 yrs but the this last visit will be the last. The Ace is a great concept, hipper than thou warholian installation a la auberge. Knowing that some rooms are better than others I reserved well in advance and requested one of the deluxe rooms in the back. When i arrived they'd given the room to someone else offering the excuse, well, the previous guest decided to stay an extra day, and the front desk person was very rude and put out by the whole exchange. The room i ended up with was small dark and very noisy. It was impossible to sleep or enjoy staying in the room as you could hear everthing from the adjacent rooms. Nothing like listening to Cops blasting from the room next door at 1AM, or hearing your neighbors snoring, coughing, flushing their toilet, and wondering how much they could hear as well. Unless you're twenty something and planning on partying all night and coming home and passing out aka leading the psuedo rock star life style i suggest stearing clear. There are plenty of other places in the area to stay.",1
531,531,"Womb-like Our room was in the center of the hotel and was architecturally interesting (our headboard was a floor-to- ceiling plate glass shower wall) we had a patio, but no window.

Nice - relaxing - recommended.",4

After having wrestled with eight pieces of luggage for several days, they were dumbfounded to see that the hotel is a walkup.No problemo. A couple fellas got the luggage both in and out of the hotel in fine form. The only thing the ladies had to do with their pieces of luggage was sit on them in order to zip them back up.Soooooo......staff was helpful in every regard, rooms were clean and interesting. Thoughtful of the maid to leave the ladies a package of MMs instead of the Kama Sutra book and a condom.",4
534,534,"Mucho $$ for a whole lotta nada ... My first stay at the ace was good: hip sublime minimal ... unfortunately it's been downhill from there. My second and third visits proved to be frustrating, irritating and uncomfortable. The rooms have been small, dark, with hollow sheet rock walls seperating the rooms. You can hear everything .... EVERYTHING. The neighbors on one side left their tv on all night (it's probably still on), the ones on the other side came home around 2AM had loud sex and then spent the rest of the morning puking in the bathroom (another reason not to opt for a shared bath). There is no service except for there front desk where you'll find a terse urban hipster with multiple peircings reading a magazine and chatting on her cell phone who makes it known that you are a bother. The place has great possibities, unfortunately they are not realized. After 3 visits I give up.",2
535,535,"Liked the Ace A Lot I stayed at The Ace for 5 days this March and really liked it. It was clean, very accessible to nearby restaurants (some pricey ones though so be aware), and had a nice staff. They were helpful in suggestions on where to eat and one nice woman helped my boyfriend and I down the stairs with our luggage which wasn't necessary but very nice of her. I really liked the decor of the room too. It was simple but perfect if you're used to non-fussy places. The shared bathrooms were clean and the maids cleaned the room up nicely every day. I didn't encounter any noise problems but that is because when I booked the room, I specifically asked for a quieter side that did not face the noisey street. It was quiet and pleasant and I'm a light sleeper. The Cyclops downstairs had good food and a fun atmostsphere. One drawback I would say is that it's hard to find an inexpensive place to get something to eat in the neighborhood. Also, going alone to the bathroom at night seemed a bit sketchy because the halls were very dimly lit to look cooler, I guess but I was a little paranoid of going to the shared bathrooms without my boyfriend in the middle of the night. Other than that, I would definitely recommend the place to anyone who wants a fun, no-frills place to stay that's convenient to everything.",4
536,536,"Ick we were totally disappointed. loved the concept of the hotel, but the reality was very disappointing. room was dirty: various stains on the walls; unclean and uncomfortable bedding; broken, dirty furniture; bedside table ripped out of the wall and dangling; stains on the carpeting; stuffy and airless; on the up side, the shared bathrooms were clean; the location is good; the staff was nice, although not overly knowlegeable about the area/where to find secured parking.",2

My poor friend spent about 20 minutes drive around looking for parking while another friend tried to get the front desk clerk to tell her where we could park but he was too busy on a personal call to talk to her. We finally did find parking on our own. He seemed sort of blas茅 about the entire thing. Well, besides the staff, I loved the hotel and we had a great weekend.

In spite of the problems they were facing, the staff were, without exception, warm and friendly, and the service at the front desk, restaurant (terrific food) and the bar was wonderful.

Stayed here in Jan. 2008, had a big room (2 queen beds), no view (freeway side), but great morning light with a huge window made up for my other complaints; weak, drippy shower and water stains above the bed.Staff was friendly, valet guys quick; think I even got free parking by some kind of mistake.But, this August trip was terrible. Small tiny room, single queen, pitiful view of back alley, elevators broken (had to take stairs in the am).What I find really disappointing is that as a former guest, one would think they would do right by me coming back.I'm going to try the Hyatt next.",2
553,553,"Comfortable Crowne Plaza This was one of several conference hotels. It was quite comfortable, the beds were comfortable, the shower worked well, the room was clean, we had a good view from our room of the Space Needle and the location is good. We were able to walk easily to Pike's Market with a straight shot to the Pier. I knew there would be a lot of walking, but that is Seattle. The staff were cordial and helpful when we needed assistance. We did not have a car, so no issue there. The elevator was not a problem as far as wait time for us. I did happen to jump on the staff/service elevator once which embarrassed my daughter no end, but the staff just laughed it off. It was October so the air conditioner was not an issue either. No noise issues for us and we even had a connecting room with the extra door. Overall, a very comfortable stay and I would stay here again.",4
554,554,"Great service, but property has a few issues First of all, I had absolutely no problems with the service here. The front desk personnel, bar and restaurant staff, the valet/bell staff, and various employees I encountered in common areas were all extremely friendly and helpful. This was actually some of the best service I have encountered.The location was terrific. You can walk to Pike's Market, downtown shopping and restaurants, and to the monorail if you want to go to the space needle.I thought the food was terrific. I had breakfast there once, lunch twice and appetizers in the bar twice. The breakfast was a bit overpriced, but the lunch was worth it and the happy hour appetizers were a steal.The mixed drinks were just okay- I would stick with beer or wine. And I think the happy hour drinks were not that great of a deal.The city view from the room was spectacular- especially at night.There were negatives, though, which definately counter balanced all that great customer service. First of all, the rooms are worn and outdated. The furniture is nicked up, the wall paper was peeling, the carpet seams were lifting- and this was in a executive suite.The elevators were loud- I actually appreciated the loud heater because it drowned out the noise from the elevators and hallway (you could hear every conversation through the walls and doors).There were not enough working lightbulbs for the lamps. The lamp shades were askew so I don't know how housekeeping missed that.The elevators were extremely slow. More than once I waited almost ten minutes to get down to the lobby. I was there on business, so I had a schedule to adhere to and the elevators really were a problems for me.If you want good service and a great location, and don't necessarily need a newer, well maintained room, this is a great place. For the overall cost though, I don't think this property was up to par.",3
555,555,"Solid hotel I stayed at the hotel with friends last weekend and we had a great stay. We got a free upgrade and rooms on the 29th floor with amazings views onto the city, space needle and the ocean. The rooms were very spacious, with a large flat screen TV. They should offer a few more channels though. Beds were comfortable, bathroom and its amenities basic. Would have expected better from a 4* hotel. As a Priority Club member we got a sleep well package in the room upon c/in with ear plugs, lavender spray and a relaxation CD. Nice touch. We also received complimentray appetizer coupons for the bar which we used the first evening. Food and drinks were ok, the waitress rather unfriendly and the live music/ Jazz singer was horrible. Not worth paying her any money for that so called singing. Parking is available through valet only and costs $30.00 a day. Not cheap but standard for a downtown location. The hotel is conveniently located, close to businesses and shops. We walked almost everywhere and took public transportation once. We cannot confirm the trouble with the elevators that other reviews state, but it might have to do with the season. The hotel didn't seem very busy last weekend. Air conditioning in one of the rooms was noisy. Would definitely stay here again.",5
556,556,"warning!!!!!!!! My husband and I stayed here before our Alaskan cruise. We arrived didn't wait too long to check in. We were given our room waited forever for the elevator to the 17th floor. Opened the door and there was underware on the bed (unmade bed) hairbrush in bathroom and didn't look any further. Went got another room thank goodness the bellhop was with us this time to the 26th floor oh yeah had to wait again to go down and up need more elevators. Went to our new room and keys did not work bell hop took care of it. Then while waiting for him we attempted to turn on the tv and it didn't work so they sent a repair man. It did get fixed but stopped working. gave up. Check out was okay didn't complain because they already had our complaints and didn't do anything. (I work in a service industry and you should not have to complain to get things the way they should be if there is a problem you know and remedy it and check how things are going)Breakfast buffet in hotel is good.Well, this experience has soiled my image of crowne plazaWe usually do not stay in fancy hotels I guess we expected too much had much better rooms and service at Days Inn and Comfort inn.",2
557,557,"No problems at the Crowne Plaza, Seattle, Washington, USA Our Travel Agent booked this Hotel as part of a Cruise and stay holiday. Before we left, we read with dismay the majority of the reviews on the Crowne Plaza Hotel Seattle. On arrival we were surprised to find that our room (on the 19th floor) was much better than average - large, well equipped and very clean with two Queen size beds. We thought that the decor was nice, a little Art Deco but we liked that. We also found that the lifts were no problem at all and we used them several times during our two night stay. All in all we were extremely satisfied with the Hotel. We have to agree with the comments about the noisy Air Conditioning units but although the weather was beautiful during our stay, we had no need to use it at night so it wasn't a problem to us.I have stayed in several Hotels worldwide both for business and pleasure and this is certainly one of the better ones I have stayed at.",4
558,558,"Another disapointing stay - and a free one at that! My husband and I stayed at the Crowne Plaza in August 2007 with some friends for a weekend get away. The room was nice and they were very accommodating putting us across the hall from each other. Unfortunately that was the only good part about our stay. Around midnight we had a very loud man outside our door trying to get in. From what we could hear of his conversation with his friend he had been told our room was actually his. He gave up and went away but came back about 1 hour later. Again, of course, he could not get in. We did not open the day for our own safety. About 1am we get a knock on the door. My husband checks and it is a hotel staff member so he opens the door. He then gets asked many times if he is a registered guest. Eventually the employee left. When we went to check out the next morning we mentioned it to the front desk manager and were surprised that her only response was an Oh. We are not ones to make a fuss and were actually quite shocked so we left it. We also mentioned the garbage smell blowing from the fan outside our room. Again we got an Oh. We left our luggage with the concierge and went out for the day. When we returned we found that the concierge had somehow managed to lose our luggage! They had us run to three separate spots with them to find our own bags. I complained on their corporate website and received a $50 coupon - oh wow! Eventually I got a call from the hotel and the general manager offered a free night stay. Much better. I went for my free night at the beginning of August. Unfortunately it wasn't any better. The front desk person was rude; the room was ok but was at the same end of the floor that has a garbage smell coming from the fan. The concierge is a mess and it took forever to get our car back when we wanted to leave. For $30 I would think I should have to wait 20 minutes. The only polite person I met that worked for the hotel was the man cleaning the rooms. He was very nice; they should give him a big raise. Obviously I will not stay at this hotel ever again. I would have hoped they would have tried better to win me over but they seem to have little care for their customers. For over $200 a night this is not worth it. We stayed at the Westin Seattle for less and it is far and above a better hotel.",1

OK let's start:-the worst hotel I have been to since I am a member of tripadvisor and I review only half of the hotel I visit.-70's like room with stainy carpet.-Turn on your A/C and you listen to an airplane's engine start.-Most of 2 stars motels on a freeway have better bathrooms.-Wonderful view on a busy and noisy motorway.-Almost not existent lobby and very sad indeed.-The evelator issue is far from been solved, so plan 5 minutes each way to go to breakfast (just OK).-Told me I didn't have breakfast included because the system was down, so I had to show the copy of my reservation.

560,560,"Nice, but some issues This was my second stay at this location. Great view, nice room. As a Priority Club Member(Intercontinental Hotels' Loyalty program), I was given a nice little package upon arrival, which told me I could locate my complimentary drinks and snacks in the refrigerator in my room. You guessed it, no fridge, no snacks, no drinks. Not that big of a deal, just an irritating detail. Elevators are SLOW. Give yourself about ten minutes to get down to the lobby. Also, water pressure/hot water in my room was abysmal.Valet parking is mandatory, and costs $30.00/day. Ridiculous, but par for the course in Seattle. The good: nicely accoutremented room(save for the missing fridge), with a brand new, huge flatscreen, comfy beds/linens, and a giant window to look out over the city. Spectacular view. Internet service was fast when it worked, which was about 80% of the time. This will set you back $10.00/day. I recommend it, but cautiously. Seems like you should get just a little more bang for your buck at these prices.",4

We had to take the stairs from the 31st floor. It was endless waiting the entire week. The club lounge is pathetically small and there was no where to sit for breakfast (so don't bother upgrading to the club floor). The room air conditioning keeps you awake (even with the supplied ear plugs).For the price it was a very average hotel.",2

Clean, quiet rooms.The downside to this hotel is the restaurant, which serves typically overpriced hotel meals. There are a lot of restaurants nearby with better food for less $. If you need a quick fix and something cheap, there's a Subway sandwich shop just outside the front door of the hotel. Sure beats the cost of room service!",5
563,563,"Our stay at the Crowne Plaza We had concerns about staying here after reading reviews concerning the elevators. We had absolutely no problems. We were there from a Thursday night through Sunday morning. It was clean and we enjoyed the spaciousness and views. Some fruits were in the lobby in the morning, but it seems for the price more of a continental breakfast should be made available. We did not rent a car--after reading on Trip Advisor, we discovered none was needed for Seattle. That way we avoided the parking fee. The concierge could have been more of a help to us with understanding the metro system--in fact, she was no help at all--just told us to look at the signs. We should have studied these routes more through the internet and Trip Advisor forums because we did lose time with this. A couple of friendly Seatllers were more helpful than the concierge. Overall, we had a pleasant stay here. Location was great for our purposes.",4

565,565,"Great rooms, but... My family had 3 rooms at the Crowne Plaza following an Alaskan cruise. The hotel has unusually large rooms with fantastic views, very comfortable beds, good air conditioning and great showers. However, I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone for the foreseeable future due to terrible elevator issues. This is a 34-story hotel with 4 elevators, 3 of which were working during our stay (we were told that they are in the process of replacing all elevators). This, along with the very small lobby, resulted in horrible crowding as guests wait 5 minutes or more for an elevator. To avoid missing a shuttle bus that we booked, we had to leave our rooms 30 minutes before departure time. All elevators going down were completely packed, so we had to ride the elevator up to the top (stopping on every floor), then back down (again stopping on every floor). That's 33 stops to leave the hotel -- and at every stop we'd see frustrated guests who couldn't fit. Many gave up and took the stairs all the way down.Avoid at all costs until the elevators are replaced.",3
566,566,"Wonderful Time We booked a double room on the executive level, which costs a bit more but is well worth it.

Our beds were comfortable and, as they hotel promised, our floor was quiet, except for the second night, when a bunch of drunks were in the executive lounge talking loudly after 11:00 p.m. We called the front desk, and they immediately addressed the issue and it was quiet after 15 minutes. Staff is courteous, friendly and attentive. That alone makes this place noteworthy, in my book, as I have had too many incidents with rude hotel staff in my lifetime. Staying on the executive level provided us with nice amenities such as quiet zones, complimentary evening hors d'oeuvres, bottled water, complimentary continental breakfast, a room safe, mini fridge, among others. The only reason why I did not give this an excellent rating was the elevator issue. They have four elevators, but only two were in operation, which made it very slow going! Fortunately whenever staff saw us waiting, they allowed us to use the faster service elevator they use themselves, which is another reason to laud the great staff at this hotel.Valet parking is $30.00 per night, which is standard for a downtown Seattle hotel. Parking is secured, which is better than at the Hilton. Our location was great, allowing us to walk everywhere and experience the bustle of downtown Seattle, yet when we returned to our room, it was like a peaceful, private oasis. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone, and will certainly stay again when I want to spend the night in downtown Seattle.",4
567,567,"Not bad, not great Our family of four (2 adutls, 2 children) stayed at the Crowne Plaza at the end of June. Overall, the hotel was fine in all the basic categories: the rooms were fairly nice, comfortable beds, nice LCD TV, clean, and so on. The hotel has a good location. It's only about 10 minutes walking -- leisurely -- to the waterfront and you can walk to Qwest or Safeco field if you've got the time. Similarly, Seattle center isn't far and can be reached by mono rail about 5 blocks from the hotel. So, why the middling review you say? We booked on Hotwire, so we were paying less that $100 a night for the hotel. Any more and I would've been a little more disappointed. The biggest complaints I have are the incidental charges. Now, I know 'there are no free lunches' but I have not stayed in a hotel in years that didn't provide WiFi in the room rate (it was $9.95 for tv internet and, I think, the same for a regular lap top connection). The hotel's parking garage is valet parking and goes for $35 a day. I thought this was outrageous until I discovered how much parking costs everywhere in Seattle, but really the parking was nearly half as much as the room rate PER NIGHT. I read on another review too that elevators take a long, long time and this is true, but not the type of thing to upset me much. Rather, I don't like being 'nickel and dimed.'I'd say the hotel is acceptable, not as affordable as it looks, and I probably wouldn't stay again based on the combination of the two. I think a better value can be had for the cost and without the hassle of being charged for things you'd generally not expect to pay for.",3
568,568,"Musky smell The room smelled old and musky. It took me a while to get used to the smell. Luckily we stayed there only 1 night. We requested for a room on the quieter side of the building, so we were given a room on the 30th Floor, facing the south. We could still see the highway, but the noise was barely noticeable. Otherwise, the room was clean enough. Liked the roomy room and bathroom. Covenient location off the highway and access to D/T and Pike Place.",2
569,569,"Decent but nothing over which to fave I stayed at the Crowne Plaza during the SLA conference just this week. The hotel was nice enough and our room, at least, was quite big (we had two double beds). The elevators are horribly slow (as at least one previous review mentioned) and while we were there one of them was out of operation. This gets to be a pain in the butt after you've been out and about all day...standing and waiting for what seems like forever (and there's no way to tell where the dang elevators are, just a light for when they arrive).The Crowne Plaza is right next to the highway but we noticed no noise. It's also hard by the YWCA which has some interesting characters always hanging around. It's a clean place with very helpful staff (the bellmen were the best) although it is not in what I would consider the main happening part of downtown. Oh and also, it is an uphill walk from what seems like almost everywhere. It's not a bad uphill walk but again, at the end of the day it can be a bit tiring.I'd probably stay somewhere else my next time around but I think the Crowne Plaza is a safe bet for most travelers.",4
570,570,"Dated Hotel - Needs Refresh and a Good Scrub Down I travel extensively and used to the ocassional bumps in the road when it comes to hotels. When I arrived at this hotel in mid-afternoon I was told there were no rooms available to match my reservation request (king bed). After extensive negotiations, a king room became available, albeit a handicapped room. The hotel was selected for a group meeting, and as we gathered for our meeting, conversations centered around the 'need to fix' elements of the hotel. So while it could be said this review is based upon a single individual's experience, our group of twenty confirmed their disappointment with the hotel.  The list:  - Low water pressure - plan an extra ten minutes for your shower.  - Hair dryers were old and had little drying power. I gave up after twenty minutes (usually five minutes or less with a decent hair dryer) as it was raining in Seattle anyway. As an added bonus, when you turn on the hairdryer, the bathroom lights flicker. - There are FOUR elevators on the main floor, however the room floors only have access to TWO of the elevators. One elevator only worked stopping at each floor ASCENDING and didn't stop on DESCENDING The second elevator did stop at descending floors, yet was packed with people. After waiting 10 minutes for an elevator, I opted to get on the 'going up only' elevator, that stopped at every floor (32 of them) then quickly descended to the main floor. NOTE: the hotel staff did admit work was being done on the elevators, however two working elevators for a 32 story hotel is unacceptable. - Room carpet needed cleaning, and the dark walls and decor prompting turning on every light in the room to navigate. Hotel room colors are brown, dark orange, and medium yellow. - Lounge wait staff was very friendly, and service was good. - This hotel is right off the freeway and if you're traveling by taxi, it's easy to get out of the cab and enter the hotel. If you're renting a car and staying at the hotel, there is no space in front of the hotel to leave your car, check in and park. So plan to park your car in the garage and then take your bags with you to check in to the hotel.  - If you're okay with horns honking, the freeway exit ramp is located at the hotel entrance, as well as a major left turn from a main street. Any congestion in front of the hotel will prompt usually polite Seattle drivers to honk once or twice to remind folks that the front area of the hotel is a live street lane. Summary: I will choose another hotel for my next trip.",2
571,571,"a room with a view If your room is on the right floor and you pay that little bit extra for the view, weather permitting, that view will be spectacular. The staff is courteous, the lounge is amusing, the d茅cor is elegant and the breakfast is yummy. We've stayed here twice and each visit is enjoyable.",4
572,572,"Decent hotel to stay in downtown Seattle The hotel has a great location surrounded by park, restaurants and shopping center. The hotel clerk was very friendly at the front desk. She even lets us do a late check out with my husband's crown membership even though we booked via priceline with a much lower price. We also got a room at one of the club member only floors, and the view is fantastic. We can see the puget sound and space needle. Of course the view will be much better if the weather is not so groomy, but again it's Seattle, one can't expect too much from this rainy city. :)",5
573,573,"Crowne Plaza, beautiful, clean, highrise next to very busy freeway The Crowne Plaza Seattle is a beautiful, sleek highrise with very clean, bright modern rooms. I wish the rooms were furnished with a small refrigerator for guests refreshments and not charge for WI-FI as they do, (hint to the management).Although the building was built in 1980's right next to the very busy I-5 freeway (which was there first), I was disappointed to see that every room have older single pane windows. The freeway noise is dampened somewhat, but very audible to light sleepers or day sleepers. I could hear pre-school chldren playing in Freeway Park from a 24th floor room.The Crowne Plaza is beautiful, clean and modern, so if you can nab an affordable priceline type room rate, I say book it. But for more than $130/night, I recommend looking at other hotel options closer to Seattle's main downtown attractions, away from the freeway.",3
574,574,"Good, Good, Good! I went to Seattle for a girl's weekend of shopping, eating and FUN. This hotel was included in the package with airfare from travelocity.Everything about this hotel was good. Good service, good location, good room. Ok, I take that back, the view from our room (2454) was EXCELLENT. The girlfriend who was sharing the room with me said that it was the nicest hotel she had stayed in when her parents weren't paying! She's a little cheap, though :)The hotel and rooms were quiet, clean and safe. They were big enough to fit me and my roomie and all of our shopping bags (and there were plenty) comfortably. The maid service was polite and never bothered us - even when we were sleeping in a little late.There were TONS of families with small children staying int his place and I couldn't quite figure out why (I didn't see anything particularly kid friendly) - unless they got a good deal like we did through a website.I love to walk so the location was excellent for me. If you don't like to or unable to walk a distance you may want to find a property a little closer to shopping and the Pike's market.There is NOT 24 hour room service so if you find you need to eat at 4am, I would recomend Milano's Pizza. They deliver. I can't comment on the hotel food. Never ate it.HINT: This is one of the 1st stops for the Bus shuttle service so it is a BARAGIN to pay $17 to take that service from the airport rather than a cab. Hope this helps. Sorry, no photos of this property.",4
575,575,"Very Nice Hotel My husband and I stayed at the Crown Plaza during spring break. Upon arrival, we were told that we would be given a room with two beds, even though I had booked a king bed. The matter was resolved quickly. The staff was helpful and met our requests. The room was large, clean, quiet and had a great view. The location of the hotel is decent. Overall, it was great experience. I really have no complaints (though, as others have said, the elevators are a bit slow). I would stay there again!",4
576,576,"Decent Hotel But Paper Thin Walls Stayed at the Crowne Plaza Seattle for 3 nights during the Easter Weekend. The hotel is located about 5 or 6 mins walk to the main shopping area. The room was clean and had a 37 inch flat screen tv, there is also a radio alarm clock with cd player.The only negative point is that I could hear everything that was going on in the room next door due to the paper thin walls and there was no fridge in the room to keep drinks cool.If you are flying in to Seattle try the Gray Line Downtown Airporter bus which drops off at the Crowne Plaza for only $17 return. It's alot cheaper than a cab.",3
577,577,"Okay Experience This was a decent hotel but there are better ones in this price range. There was a cute bag of signature Crowne Plaza goodies on the bed when I walked in--scented pillow spray, an eye pillow, CD, etc. It was a nice touch and I actually used the eye pillow and spray. The elevators took absolutely FOREVER. One of them was broken, and the hotel was pretty full, so that was definately a factor, but I was on an upper floor and I am not exaggerating, it would take 5-7 minutes for the elevator to come almost every time. Overall, this is a nice property and had no real flaws. Great location!",3
578,578,Very Nice!       View from my room on the 29th floor,4
579,579,bad first impression Unfortunately I had a very negative first impression of this hotel because of the staff when I checked in. We stayed two nights and the rest of the visit was fine. I liked the bed except that the mattress pad was bunched up under the sheets and didn't go all the way to the foot of the bed. The best part of the stay was the free fitness room. The business center was also convenient.,3
580,580,"nice hotel, nice place Stayed 3 nights pre Alaskan cruise last year. Hotel was good, just as expected. Decent location. Excellent beds. Lovely room with view over the city. My only gripe is that Seattle had the most panhandlers we have EVER experienced anywhere. In the world. It was disconcerting at times as some were aggressive and pushy.However, Seattle was great. We especially enjoyed the Underground Tour and riding the Ducks!",4
581,581,"Not worth the money The Seattle downtown Crowne Plaza hotel is a very typical average business hotel without amosphere. It is situated near the I90 / I5 and even on the 23rd floor where I was, you can hear the sound of the highway considerably. Rooms are large and clean, beds are OK. Breakfast is reasonable, but typical American style (fat and sweet). Bar and restaurant are quite expensive, but a rich choice of downtown bars and restaurants are within walking distance. If you arrive from the airport, bear in mind that you cannot checkin before 4 pm.",2

583,583,"Great stay Stayed at this property in August and November. As noted by others, long elevator waiting time was experienced in August but greatly improved in November. Hotel is located near highway and is on the Greyline Airporter stops. Very good location, walking distance to Pike Place, and downtown shopping malls.Found the staff to be pleasant during both stays. Rooms are adequate in size and beds extremely comfortable. Rooms XX65 are corner rooms which are very spacious and have nice views. Rooms XX51 are located near ice and vending machines and may be noisy. Room service is fast and tasty but expensive and not too many choices for dinner. Overall well worth the price for the $150 to $200 price range.",4
584,584,"Now this is a nice hotel!! I arrived late from a flight and was pleased to find a very beautiful crowne plaza hotel. $129 a night - Excellent value and an Excellent stay.There is Valet parking for $28 a night and I took that so I don't know if there is a parking ramp close to it or not.Check in was fast and very professional. The room was clean, soft King size bed, quiet, good food (room service), and updated or just very well taken care of. Check out had a few problems. I was double charged for Valet - Corrected. And I didn't like the front desk managers (Morning) attitude. He seemed busy doing nothing and let me stand there for awhile as he poked at the key board. I was going to complain, but that seems to never get a response any longer.Easy to get on the freeway.",4
585,585,"Seattle Crown Plaza not worth the money We got in late to the hotel (1230pm) and they gave away my reservation for a king sized bed though I had travel/business for four days booked at the hotel. The girl at the reception desk was asked if that was b/c we were late she blamed the day shift for giving away the room since 4pm. Then the first thing she said was There's nothing else I can do for you proceded by an offer for breakfast and to change our room in the morning. She was rude, could not make good eye contact and I had to ask for her manager's name. They didn't have a manager until the morning. The next few days people were much more helpful and pleasant to deal with. But I found the hotel accomodations itself so so. It seemed old and in need of a lot of renovations. For example, the wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling off. Once we got into our king bedroom, they gave us a corner room probably for our inconvenience. However, the furniture did not seem to fit the room. The TV was small and the dressers were small. We tried to use the safe in the room but it was broken. We immediately called the front desk and asked for help. Three days later we checked out and it was never addressed. One good thing about it though was the food. The breakfast buffet was healthy and very good. We had lunch there too (the manager was trying to make up for her poorly trained employee) and the clam chowder, salmon and spinach salad and crab cakes were really good.",2
586,586,"Boring but pleasant - not really worth the money. We stayed here for a conference. Our view from the 18th floor was of a highway spaghetti bowl. The beds were excellent, the room was spacious. Elevators still stupidly slow, and it wouldn't have mattered if the hallways hadn't smelled terrible - like sour milk. Other folks told me this was true on their floors, too. Earlier in the week we'd stayed in a motel on Bainbridge Island for $80 a night. I'm not sure what the extra $150+ for the Crowne Plaza got us besides a downtown location and a little more floorspace.",3
587,587,"Priority Award Floor? 32 I am a member of Hilton Honors and Priority Award (Intercontinental Chain). Although I use Hilton properties more, I chose not to pay over $250.00 a night for the Seattle Hilton.I was given a gold hotel room key at checkin for a room on the 32nd floor. Although the view was quite impressive, that is where the good experience ended.  The 32nd floor is reserved for Priority Members and has a lounge for complimentary appetizers in the evening. My room was adjacent to the elevator as well as across from the lounge. After dinner I returned to my room around 9:30. Between 10- 12 Pm/Am the lounge is cleaned up by the hotel staff with vacuums going and the employees chattering and making incessant noise, as if they were cleaning up a commercial office building with no regard to guests (Priority Club, no less) on the floor. Management should take a clue and have the lounge cleaned up between 8-9- common sense.Finally, as other posters have indicated -- when you are right next to the elevator shaft, you will hear it. Also, I waited for 10 minutes for an elevator to arrive around 5:00 PM. Should have taken a clue when I saw the earplugs and sleep kit on my bed at check - in.",2
588,588,Excelllent Hotel Had a wonderful experience at this hotel. The Baltimore Orioles were staying in the hotel at the same time and it was nice to see the fans outside the hotel after the games. The front desk was wonderful. I had a room on the 28th floor which I could see the water and it was great.,5
589,589,Great hotel The hotel was nice and our room was really comfortable and clean. The location was also pretty good...it was only a few blocks from Pike Place Market and the waterfront. I'd definitely stay here again if I'm in Seattle.,5
590,590,"Everything you might expect from the Crowne Plaza Brand Although we had reserved a non-smoking king we were advised that none were available upon arrival. However, the hotel was willing to accomodate us by offering a corner n/s room with a queen size bed (handicapped room), which turned out to be a king sized bed. The staff was very professional, but, as far as recommendations were concered well, they had their moments. Suffice it to say however, that we were definetly steered in the right direction on restaurant suggestions. It is a few blocks walk from Pike Place Market; however, it is not inconvenient. So when you hear the term within walking distance - believe it. You are about 3-4 blocks from wonderful shopping and the monorail to the Space Needle. And, there are several wonderful places to eat around this area.Clean, quiet  comfortable room and, although we would shop around for prices, we would definetly stay here again. I have always considered Crowne Plaza's a little bit of a cut above sometimes on par with some of the Hiltons and Sheratons I've stayed in. This one held up the Crowne Plaza reputation I have come to enjoy. Although we didn't eat at the hotel they do have a restaurant. We saw many families and tourist groups, as well as a business conference attendees in the lobby, so, I would recommend considering this hotel for business or pleasure travel. Our trip was both.",4
591,591,"Hmmm...not really good enough So I'm a Intercontinental Hotels Platinum card member, so I did get upgraded to a Club level suite. So the fact that I found the whole stay pretty average says a lot.The location is not great, the staff are more interested in themselves then helping guests (in one case advising me to take my 9 year old son to a 21+ only bowling / entetainment location. The club level free breakfast often was poorly staffed so that it all ran out if a few people came at the same time.I've stayed at many Crowne Plaza hotels and this one, a franchise, just is not up to it.",3
592,592,"Great stay, but the MUST do something about the elevators! Agree with previous posts about this hotel's elevators. I stayed 4 nights 8/5 - 8/9. Checked into room early, was given a corner Club room on 34th floor with fabulous views of Elliott Bay, Space Needle, Lake Union. The bed was great. I think I slept better than I had in weeks! The morning Club Level continental breakfast and afternoon snacks were very good. I ordered room service twice, just pizza or sandwich and they arrived promptly. Pizza was actually pretty good! I was impressed with the desk personnel who called me by name each time they saw me. The only mishap I had was locking myself out of my room . . . in my gown when I was putting the room service tray out for housekeeping to pick up. Duh! I went down the hall and heard some people in one of the rooms and knocked. They let me use the phone to call the front desk. A security guard showed up in 3 - 4 minutes! He used the service elevator which apparently is never freed up for the public. The elevators were the only complaint I had during my stay there. We have more business in Seattle and I will definitely stay at Crowne Plaza again! Like the other poster, I will just plan to leave early to catch an elevator!",5
593,593,"Pleasant Stay - but hotel needs to address the elevator issues Stayed at the Crowne Plaza Seattle for five nights at the beginning of August and had a pleasant stay.I had reserved a view room, and was able to check-in immediately upon arrival, about noon. Although I had not paid the higher rate for a club level room, because I am a Priority Club Gold level member, I was given access to the club lounge for continental breakfast and evening snacks. There was also access to a microwave for making popcorn at night.The view room was on a high floor (30) and overlooked the city and bay instead of the freeway. Worth the extra $$. It was a large room, with a desk/chair and an additional arm chair.The location was in downtown, close to shopping areas. BUT, everywhere to walk is downhill, which means it is a long uphill walk back. Pike's Market is definitely walking distance to get there - but I took a cab back up the hill. I was taking in Sox/Mariners games at Safeco field, and Safeco (and the adjacent Quest field) are about a 20-25 minute walk. The Concierge was not terribly helpful with directions or information on local buses --- just suggested we walk.The rooms were standard Crowne Plaza rooms: fluffy white linens, extra pillows, etc. I think in some other CPs I have stayed at the mattresses may have been pillowtop, but not this one. The mattress definitely could have been more comfortable. The rooms were very clean. Housekeeping serviced the room twice a day: in the morning they made up beds and replaced towels; later, they returned early evening and turned down the beds, closed the drapes, replaced any used towels and turned the radio on softly.I did not dine in the restaurant, but ordered room service twice. Both times I ordered just sandwiches, but they were good and arrived quickly and hot. Room service is available late - until about 1AM. The breakfast in the club lounge was more than adequate. There was a large selection of bagels, muffins, danish and scones, assorted cereals, assorted fruit and choices of coffee, tea and juices.The lobby was always extremely crowded during the day. There seems to be a convention of some sort going on, and they had taken over several function areas as well as the lobby.The biggest problem was the elevator service. The hotel was quite full due to this event. While there was a bank of 4 elevators visible, it appears that at least one was locked down for service use, and another may have been out of service. I never saw it operating. That left 2 slow elevators to service a full 34 floor hotel. One evening I returned around 11PM to literally find a line of folks across the lobby waiting for elevators. It took me 25 minutes to get up to my room. Even more annoying was that the hotel staff seemed unconcerned by this and did not open up the service elevator. At other times there were quite long waits, but 25 minutes was the worst.Overall, I liked this hotel. Next time I may look into staying somewhere a bit closer to the waterfront, but if the rate was better, I wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Crowne Plaza again. (I'd just need to remember to be patient when calling an elevator.)",4
594,594,"It is a Holiday Inn!! 1st time to Seattle for a delayed anniversary trip so I wanted to stay at some nicer hotels but our room reminded us more of a Holiday Inn level hotel. It was a plain room with a few extra pillows. The bathroom had an ordinary corian sink in an ordinary bathroom. Our room was on a higher floor looking down on the freeway, which was very loud. There is a reason they give earplugs and a sleep CD. We asked to switch rooms and was told they were full and would probably stay that way through our stay which was only for 2 nights since we were staying in another hotel to be in a different area of town. After we put our luggage in our room, we decided to go get something to eat. We stopped at the Concierge and asked what was a good place to walk to and was rudely told to just walk around the area and we would find something. Not sure if he was the Concierge or a doorman just sitting at the desk but we expected some help. We decided that night to call our other hotel and see if we could come in a day earlier, which they happily said that we could. I had used club points for the Crowne rooms so maybe that is why the lousy experience but we opted to leave and go pay for a room in a luxury hotel, Hotel 1000.",2

Room service was efficient and well presented (and tasted good). Only problem we had was the wife went down with serious food poisoning from one of the fast food joints in the mall. A major problem in Seattle I'm led to believe.Overall I couldn't fault the hotel in the Emerald City, from its clean and upmarket lobby to the efficient maid service, this hotel makes you feel at home. Would certainly stay here next time I visit the city.",5

597,597,"pampered at the plaza I stayed at the Crowne Plaza for one night on business. I live only about 1 1/2 hours away, but because I had an early morning meeting and traffic can be quite congested, I needed to stay in town.  The pluses: I booked on hotwire and was given a suite with a separate bedroom for a great price. The room was immaculate and came with two TVs. The bed was quite comfortable. The extras like the sleep kit (lavender spray, ear plugs and face eye mask) and clips to hold the drapes closed were a nice touch. The food at the restaurant was excellent, and fairly priced for Seattle. If my kids were with me, I probably would have selected somewhere less expensive because there are so many great restaurants in the area. I loved the workout room,-- had great equipment, two TVs and bottled water. The minuses: (1) the location is close to the freeway and comparatively noisy; (2) the location is not as central as most downtown hotels but this is not a big problem becauses buses are freqent and free in the downtown area; (3) even from the 14th floor the view was not very good, I mostly saw nearby roofs and the streets below. Parking: Parking was slightly more expensive here (28.00) per night, but parking is expensive everywhere in the downtown area. I paid $26.00 the next night at the Red Lion. And at the red lion guests can only park until 4:00 pm on the day of check out. I was able to park until 7:00 pm at the Plaza with no extra charge. I would have stayed the next night as well but booked at the Red Lion instead because the Plaza was full. See my review of the Red Lion for comparisons. Instead I stayed a below.",5

Club level guests have access to the lounge which is located on the 32nd floor. From 7:00am to 9:00am, the lounge offers breakfast which includes pastries, muffins, bagels, cold cuts, cereal  fresh fruit. Hot and cold beverages were also included. Between 5:00pm and 7:00pm, they offer dinner snacks/finger foods like pizza, spring rolls, samosa's. Bottled juices and can pop were also available. Alcoholic drinks were an extra charge. I believe the club level louge does not serve dinner snacks on the weekends.The hotel is centrally located within walking distance to Pike Market Place, the Waterfront, and Pacific Place (Sixth Ave.  Pine).

Our room was quiet, spacious and clean, and the 2 double beds were very comfortable. The room comes with a CD player, and free welcome kit with sleeping CD, eye mask, lavender spray and ear plugs. TV was old-fashioned 25 and we had cable, but some channels were fuzzy. We had the hotel's breakfast buffet twice and enjoyed it. At $14.95 per person it was not cheap, but that includes an omlette station and the food was tasty. (There weren't really any other cheap breakfast places close by.)Elevators were really slow!

602,602,"Clean and Courteous! I stayed at the CP on June 25-27, 2007 while on a business trip in Seattle. I called once I arrived at the airport to see if I could check in early and the front desk was very accommodating. They put me in non-smoking, king size room on the 7th floor per my request for a lower level floor. The room and bathroom were extremely clean and comfortable and I'm a germaphobe so I inspected the room pretty carefully (especially after some of the reviews below). The furniture had a few scratches but was no where near the descriptions in some of the reviews below. My room looked as though it had been updated within the last year or so b/c the carpet was in good condition, the bed was very comfortable, and the linens (including the bed spread) were very clean. The room had a tv, desk, coffee pot, sleep kit for relaxation, a lounge chair and king size bed with night stands on either side. It also had plenty of lighting which was good for business. The hotel restaurant had decent food . . . it was moderately priced. The bar had a cheaper menu with sandwhiches and soups if you preferred. They would also prepare your food so you could take it to your room. The hotel also had room service but I needed a temporary break from the room. The hotel also had a gift shop with lots of things that you may have forgotten. The business center was ridiculously expensive to use. The free fitness room looked good - decent amount of equipment. The hotel is only about 5 blocks from the Westlake Center shopping and the monorail to the Space Center. You can easily walk to it. Also, if you are in the touristy area of Seattle, you can take the buses for free between 6am-7pm. Grab a Seattle Map and look for the key to the free bus area. The walls are very thin but I feel that is to be expected and most of the guests respected the other guest's schedules. I would definitely return on business.",5
603,603,"ok hotel, nothing special Enjoyed stay, got good price on Hotwire. Would not have paid the regular rate. Location is close to downtown shopping. Walkable distance to Pike Place Market. Parking is 30.00. Our view was not good. It was of the Hilton next door. Room was average. Very small beds.",3
604,604,"Great for the price We stayed here for 2 nights in May for our sons birthday. Took in the M's vs. Yankees games both Saturday  Sunday. The room was clean, looked like it had been recently updated. The beds were comfortable, only complaint is that the room had 2 double beds instead of 2 Queen beds. Double is a little small for 2 especially when you are used to a King, but we survived. The parking is crazy expensive for $28/night, so since we knew we would not need our car for the entire weekend, we parked at the convention center for $17 a night and walked to the hotel, which is only a few blocks.The elevators are very, very slow. My husband and son went to the breakfast buffet and said it was very expensive for what they got.For the price we paid $85.00/night, I would definately stay there again. For their published rack rate of over $200 a night, no way.We really enjoyed the location and were able to walk to all parts of the city. All in all we would stay again.",3
605,605,"Good location and value for downtown I stayed here because I was in town for a conference at the convention center and it was a little less expensive than the other downtown hotels. I was able to book a club room for less than the rate of a regular room at some of the other hotels. It included a continental breakfast in the club lounge with pastries, cereal and fruit, as well as early-evening appetizers (charge for alcoholic beverages, though), and I got a room on a high floor with a great view of the city. They also gave a coupon for a free appetizer at the bar.The hotel is very convenient if you have business at the convention center -- it's about a three minute walk through the park across the street directly to the convention center's side door. Everything else was fine -- decent gym and OK bar. I'd stay here and try and book a club room if I visit Seattle again.",4
606,606,"Terribly overpriced! Stayed at the Crowne Plaza in May 2007 for 4 nights during a business trip. I reserved a room at the Executive Club Level for 鈧?351 per night ! And besides that you have to pay $ 9.95 per day for wireless internet access, come on! I couldn't believe my eyes when I entered my club level room. Only basic furniture in the room, completely outdated and wornout, the desk chair could not be raised and was far too low for me, there was no other comfortable chair, colors from the seventies. The only good thing is the stunning view over Seattle from the 32nd floor. The club level has its own lounge with complementary beverages and snacks. However, it is closed on Fri and Sat. Can you believe this? Why do I book on the club level then and pay a lot of money for that?Don't forget anything when you go out because it takes ages to go up and down with the elevators. The only good thing is the location, on walking distance of the Conference Centre and anything else you want to do.Terribly overpriced hotel, depressing room, club level service ashame. My only advice is: avoid this hotel!!",1
607,607,"cool city view For $55 (plus $28 for valet parking) I got a spacious corner room on the 25th floor in their quiet zone with what felt like a panoramic city view of Seattle.....I was impressed! Check in was good; the lady gave me the best room she could (no kings available) so that was cool. The lobby is nice and moderate sized....suprising considering this is 30 plus story hotel. Valet is the only option for parking; I was surprised how much but then heard the Sheraton charges over $30....the down side of staying downtown but whatever. Marble floors in the bathrooms, crowne CD player, no minibar or fridge, room service is open until 1AM which was good.....pricing is what you'd expect, but not terrible. Restaurants seemed a few blocks off, which is fine in the daytime. Vending ($2 for 20 oz bottle) and ice are on every other floor, which is odd. There is a business center but it's not free. The Crowne beds aren't as great as some comparable hotels in my opinion, but they look good. All in all, great for the value priceline usually provides.",5
608,608,"Poor Customer Service My husband and I stayed at the Crowne Plaza last weekend (6/8 - 6/10). The facilities were great but the poor customer service (read: bad attitudes and lack of competency) put a serious damper on our experience. Some examples: the concierge service was relegated to the bell hop (charming guy, but didn't have much information), when I ordered room service, my request was met with an annoyed sigh, the people at the front desk were unable to give my husband a receipt which included all the nights he stayed and we saw another front desk employee argue with a quite pleasant customer because he didn't realize that check-in time was at 4:00. When we spoke to the manager about these problems, all we received was an insipid and insincere apology. We've consistently received much better service at lower rated hotels.",2
609,609,"Not again When we first entered the busy hotel lobby, I thought there was a prom or wedding taking place as music was blaring at an uncomfortable level. It turned out to be the evening's entertainment for the bar on the second floor.Our room was on the tenth floor, and although it was clean with a partial view, the mismatched furniture had seen better days. For $360.00 per night, I expected that the room would have a mini-bar and toiletries in the bathroom, but it didn't.The housekeepers started early in the morning and were quite noisy in the halls, but the most annoying thing about the stay was the flea bites I got from sleeping in the bed.I'll go somewhere else next time we're in Seattle.",2
610,610,"Not so bad. Pros:1. Great location, close to pike place market and two nice restaurants (tulio, wild ginger)2. Valet parking.. at first I thought holy moly, $28 per day for parking! but then as I walked around downtown, I realized the rate wasn't so bad. Most of the parking dowtown is just as expensive or even worse3. Clean rooms, clean hotel----Negatives1. Wireless internet access is spotty at best. It was just so frustrating to get access even tho I went thru their tech support and a wireless bridge.2. Walls are really thin.. had to listen to a super screamer two-yr-old all night. Very very frustrating.3. Location -- soooo very difficult to get here from the 5 South at Rush hour.. probably 20 minutes drive after you exit the 5 b/c of all the traffic. The hotels parking lot is on SENECA, not 6th. So keep that in mind when you're planning your driving routes.",3
611,611,"Great potential, many problems This hotel has a lot going for it: pleasant and professional staff, nice decor, comfortable bedding, great location, stunning views from some rooms. Nonetheless, for my needs, I cannot stay here. The biggest problem for me was that internet access in the room is an extremely weak wi-fi. At this hotel, the internet access seems to work at first, then it slows down, then it dies, then works, then dies.... ARGH!!!!!! I spent a long time on the phone with their tech support, to no avail. The hotel staff were honest with me: lot's of customers complain about our internet access. Any business class or high level tourist hotel MUST offer a reliable fast internet. Internet is integral part of life. I also experienced other problems at this hotel, such as VERY slow elevators. The elevator capacity appears to be inadequate for the size of the hotel. Also, staff are sometimes missing in action (such as a busy bar scene with no bartender, no staff at all for an extended period.). Finally, the only parking available is via valet, which can be ok, but their valet brought me the wrong car (how does one mistake a Honda Accord for a Ford Escape?). Ultimately, this hotel has great potential, but suffers from many highly irritating, easily fixable problems (other than slow elevators, which are indeed highly irritating but may prove hard to fix).",1
612,612,"Five Star price, 1 Star or less Internet. Stayed at the Crowne Plaza Seattle to attend a conference held there. They actually charge $9.95/day for the in-room wireless service. The wireless signal was 1 bar, sometimes 2 bars and generally registered as weak on my 10th floor room. To make matters worse, the provided connection is only 256kb down link and 128kb up-link speed. The connection is painfully slow and frequently just log-jams totally. It's hard to believe a five-star hotel in tech savvy Seattle would have such outdated antiquated internet connectivity and then actually have the nerve to actually charge $.9.95/day for it as well. The room is ok, not great, and appears to have been remodeled with another layer of wall paper and some paint one two many times. It does have a great view of downtown.Avoid this hotel if you need reliable internet while traveling.",2
613,613,"Loved the Crowne Plaza We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights before a cruise out of Seattle.The hotel was everything I expected. We were on the 29th floor and the view was spectacular. The room was very clean, furnished very nicely. I really cannot say anything bad about this hotel except that the restaurant was very expensive. Hotel staff were very helpful. The location is convenient and within walking distance of several attractions. I would stay here again if I could get a decent nightly rate.",4
614,614,"Just OK Stayed at the Crowne Plaza at the end of April, 2007 and it was just ok. Reserved a room on the Executive Club Level and it was a joke. They have complementary beverages and snacks EXCEPT for Fri and Sat. Hello? Don't most people stay in hotels on the weekends? They instead gave us a coupon to use at their restaurant. Who wants to eat at the hotel when you have a beautiful city like Seattle to explore? Definitely not worth the upgrade to executive. The view was spectacular, rooms were average at best. No microwave, refrigerator barely kept drinks cool. Sleeping aid package is a joke. One thing that was nice was the location. It was within walking distance from Qwest field and Pike Market. After talking with some friends that stayed at the Hyatt (and seeing their lobby and room), I will stay there next time. The Hyatt has a club regency floor that was WAY nicer than anything at the Crowne Plaza. Will not stay here again.",2
615,615,"Liked it less then expected While the lobby and website made this look like a 4-star hotel, the rooms themselves were terribly dated. $10 a night for wireless Internet Access that barely worked to the point of being unusable where I was at the end of the hall. Otherwise, the rooms were generally clean, the location is very convenient, and the price is reasonable.",3
616,616,"Nice place - had a good stay Stayed the weekend of 4/27 - 4/29. We got a good rate of $89 per night. The room was clean, comfortable, very comfy bed and nice linens. The bathroom was a good size. Our room was on the 25th floor (the quiet zone) and had a large window facing the freeway with a surprisingly nice view of the Cascades. The front desk folks were pleasant, friendly and knowledgable. They let us check in early, at 1:00, with no problem. The location is great - easy walking to everything downtown and Pioneer Square. For breakfast we found a nice bakery a couple of blocks away, Specialties, for a cheap meal.I did notice that they charge for local calls, internet service,  parking. But we didn't use any of these (took the train to Seattle) so didn't have any of these extra fees. I recommend the Crowne Plaza especiallly if you can get this good rate!",4
617,617,Great stay!       View from the room,5
618,618,"Avoid Crowne Plaza Although the location is pretty good, the overall service was horrible. The woman at the hotel reception was curt. When we got to our room we had two double beds. We called down to see if we could switch rooms to either one queen or king and the operator said no because we booked through priceline. The room was a nice size...of course it was, it had two beds. The heater was a bit smelly. The bathroom smelled like mildew, and it was difficult to find accurate water temperature on the shower. Overall, I would avoid this hotel.",2
619,619,Location great for Convention Centre events Stayed at the Crowne Plaza for two nights while attending the Flower and Garden Show at the Seattle Convention Centre. The location was perfect....a short walk to the Centre. Had a few problems with the reservation and had to clarify it more than once prior to our arrival but the staff were always helpful in straightening things out. Also had a problem at check out but again staff were quick to rectify once problem was brought to their attention. Not sure if this is common or we were just unlucky. Lots of amenities within the hotel. Room was nice and the bed was comfortable. Very clean. Elevators were a bit slow. The location worked well for this visit but iI would consider staying closer to the downtown core and waterfront another time.,4
620,620,"Great Base for the City Stayed here recently after booking the hotel on it's own website for a reasonable rate.Were over only for the weekend from the UK and had to pack plenty in over three days.Found the hotel very easily, just next to the exit Seneca on the I5. Valet parked our car which was expensive. About 拢16 ($28) per day.Check in was seamless and an unusually pleasent experience. The staff were very friendly. Took the advice from here and booked a exec room, which was not too much more. Beds were amazing as was the view, when the fog lifted. Bathroom was ok and the television had loads of channels on it.The buffet breakfast was great, but there are no eggs included so we had to eat downstairs. I liked the idea of having a seperate floor which can only be accessed by a room key.Loved the city, found plenty of bars, a great restaurant by the Benaroya Hall. Visit the Boeing Factory (about 30 miles away) it's quite breathtaking in size.Seattle made me remember why I love America and it's people so much.",4
621,621,"An Amazing Hotel - Elegant, Friendly, Comfortable This hotel is gorgeous with amazing views, a helpful staff who will bend over backward for you and a prime location. It seems like 4 star and is just a magical place to stay. My only complaint is $27 parking fee per day plus $10 wifi per day which drive the price up. But it's worth a lot to be here. I felt so cared for and it was quite elegant.They give you may extras like unbelievably comfortable beds with down duvets, night lights, clips for the curtains, sleep kits with CD, earplugs and eye shades (none of which were needed) and free coffee and Twining teas. It is elegant and even the food was good there.I highly recommend it. Location was perfect, next to the W and Marriott but I'd rather stay at the Crowne Plaza any day.",5
622,622,"just right We were ill when we arrived in Seattle and what a relief to have such a comfortable hotel room to recover in! We decided to pay a few dollars extra and get the room just one down from a suite (not too much more on advance purchase). Situated on the 32nd floor was teriffic! And an enourmous continental breakast selection was also included in the price. The location was perfect, right in downtown Seattle and the staff most helpful. We'd definitely stay here again.",4
623,623,"Solid hotel in a great location. The Crowne Plaza Seattle is a very nice and comfortable hotel in a great location. It is just off interstate 5 --which make it very easy to find. It is also within walking distance of almost all the downtown locations. Qwest field is about a 15 min walk, Pike Market about 10, and The Space Needle about 20-25. So unless you plan on traveling out of town there is little need for a rental car.Upon check in the front desk clerk asked us if we would like a high floor with a nice view of the mountains, which worked fine with us. Outside of clouds and fog the view was great. The rooms were a decent size, nothing huge but big enough, and tastefully decorated. The bathrooms fit the profile of a 4 star hotel. They were clean and came with plenty of amenties. Room service was excellent. Fast with great service. The selection could be expanded slightly though. We briefly checked out the hotel bar, which was very classy although expensive. All in all we were very satisfied with the Crowne Plaza. If you get a decent rate I would strongly reccommend it.",4
624,624,"Pretty Decent Room was nice and comfortable. The bar was terrible. Expensive drinks, bartender was awful. Had limes for drinks but did not want to cut them. He was stealing the place blind by charging for drinks but not ringing them up on the register. He added gratuity to the bill on the first night and did not mention it until I saw the receipt and commented. I have never seen an automatic gratuity added to the tab at a US bar. We didn't let our bar experience ruin our stay. The check in staff was outstanding and friendly. We liked Silver expecially.Would stay here again. $85 one night and $130 for NYE. A bargain.",4
625,625,"Good experience Having booked at last minute to escape the University Tower hotel (see review), this proved an excellent last minute find.Central, clean rooms and good views, albeit the rooms themselves even on the exec levels weren't exactly spacious.Try and book the executive rooms if possible - good choice of breakfast and hors d'oeuvres through the day makes the overall package palatable.Restaurant a little pricey but good food - if only staying one night, skip this and try Benihana just down the road from the hotel, great food and atmosphere.",5
626,626,"Great Hotel for a City Break This is a rather late review since we stayed at the Crowne Plaza Seattle in May 2006. However, since I have just joined Tripadvisor, I thought It would be useful to leave a review. My husband  I were in Seattle for a 6 night city break. Having always wanted to visit Seattle, we chose this hotel as we are priority club members  we got a good deal booking online.We had a room on the top floor (club level) with the complimentary breakfast / evening snacks  we had no gripes whatsoever. The view was incredible - the space needle  city lights at night just beautiful  the morning sun over the water amazing. The hotel is well located  easily accessible to the main department stores / downtown shopping. Yes, its a little walk to Pike Place  the Space Needle but certainly not miles  its a rather pleasant walk. We hired a car for 2 days  visited some out of town malls as well as the Boeing factory (awesome)  the Microsoft campus. We did go up the space needle  ate in the restaurant one evening - whilst the view was great, the food was only OK  you really are paying for the view (which incidentally, is not half as good as the view from the CN tower in Toronto), so I'd think twice about eating at the top of the Space Needle.All in all, we loved Seattle. The people are so friendly  go out of their way to help. The hotel was perfect for our needs. Clean, efficient  a spacious room. We would definately stay there again.",4
627,627,"Really Perfect! Great price of $120/night.Upon check in, we were given a free room upgrade, with a beautiful view and access to their complimentary breakfast the next morning.The front desk was friendly, and the room was beautiful, clean and luxurious.We had to leave early the next morning so we did not see much of the hotel but from what we saw, we were pleased.I will definitely stay here again when I am in town- I love free upgrades.",5
628,628,"Pleasant experience The location of the hotel is good and convenient; within walking distance of everywhere. We had a room on the 34th floor (Club Level) facing the water, and the view was spectacular. Room was large, newly furnished, marble bath with a very comfortable king bed. Elevators were fast (although there are only 3). The lounge is small and drinks rather pricey. Service was average, and check-in and out was prompt and courteous. Club Level includes continental breakfast, which was a money and time-saver in the mornings. It was a good experience and the hotel experience is similar to other Crowne Plaza hotels. My one gripe: since I did not make the reservation directly with the hotel, I was told my stay was non-qualifying for Priority Club reward points. That is an annoying and silly rule, and will make me think twice about booking at this hotel group again. Crowne Plaza hotels (unlike Marriott hotels) still have smoking rooms available. If you are a smoker, that is good news, if not, be sure to request a non-smoking room!",4
629,629,Great location! There were three of us traveling so we tried to book suites at in every city. We were having trouble finding a decently priced suite until we found the Crowne Plaza.The suite itself was a decent size with great views of the city. The king size bed and all the sleeping amenities made for a great sleep.The staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful. The hotel is a very short walk from the city centre and a few seconds from strips of great shops. The location is great for walking downtown and getting out of the city and back to the airport.The best part of this stay was that we were charged $40 US less a night than we had booked online!I would recommend this hotel.,4
630,630,"They forced us to stay in handy-capped room instead of King Bed Room. We booked King Bed room for a week though a travel agency, but when we arrived at the Hotel, they insisted we had no choice but stay in the handycapped room (No Bathtub, extra height for toilet, big door, queen bed) for the night. We would have accepted if they discount a little, but they did not. We could accept it if it were only one night and if they guaranteed they would change to regular room from the next day. However, they did not guarantee that. They just said they would request changing room, but they cannot guarantee it. WHY? Request to WHOM? We were talking with the front desk manager but he did not do anything about it. After we did not move the front desk for more than 15 min, one of front ladies asked the manager something, and they checked the computer, and finally they guaranteed they would change the room to regular room from the next day. See! They can do it! They just did not want to do it! If we did not insist to change it, they would force us to stay in the handycapped room for the rest of the week.",1
631,631,"An attempt at an up-scale hotel My husband and I booked a Friday and Saturday night stay at the Crowne Plaza on the Intercontinental Hotel website for our anniversary. We were able to get the government/military rate since my husband is active duty Army, which was around $170 for a club level room, which was supposed to include free evening appetizers and a free continental breakfast. We figured that was a good rate for a room on a high floor and basically four free meals, but little did we know that the club level lounge is CLOSED on Friday and Saturday nights! So we got two free breaksfasts. We did receive a coupon for one free appetizer in the Regatta Lounge (the bar inside the hotel) upon check-in. Another problem that we had was that the guest that had stayed in the room we were to occupy that night apparently did not check out. This was the day after the nightmare at the airports because of the foiled terrorist attack, and so I can understand someone changing their travel plans, but they tried to put us in a room that was subpar to what we had reserved. After a few choice words, the manager found a room on the 32nd floor and gave us one night of garage parking for free, a $27 value. We had suspicions that this room was probably in the remodeling stage, as there was a loose tile in the bathroom floor and a few small cracks where the ceiling met the walls. Even with the loose tile, the highlight of the room was the bathroom - all marble, new fixtures, a great shower, and lots of towels and toiletries. The other highlight was the bed, which was very comfortable. A few nice touches include the sleep kit, with a music CD and an eye mask; the blackout curtains, which fooled me into thinking it was still dark outside when really the sun was already up; and the hotel escape plan on the door actually lit up at night. It was a very faint light and didn't disturb our sleep at all, and I had never seen this before. I thought it was very clever. I didn't think the elevators were slow at all; we waited one time for maybe three minutes, but otherwise it was just a few seconds. They have a pretty good happy hour in the bar twice daily, and the hotel is within walking distance to everywhere. Even though we could take our car as often as we pleased, it didn't move for two days because we walked everywhere. Overall it was okay, but I think there are nicer hotels downtown for about the same price. If you are in town for a conference and don't really care about the amenities, then this hotel is for you. But if you want to be pampered, go somewhere else. Last year we stayed at the Grand Hyatt, and it was absolutely great. If you can afford it, stay at the Fairmont Olympic - it is divine. If you can't afford it, do what we did and just walk through. It's worth it just to the see the woodwork, and it's only a couple of blocks from the Crowne Plaza.",2
632,632,"Beds hard, need new mattresses I recently spent two nights at the Crowne Plaza. I have stayed at other CP hotels and been impressed. Our stay at this property was at best average. I find Seattle to be generally expensive when it comes to accommodation but the beds were hard, the food was bad and the service was mediocre. Although the location was good, I will try another hotel on my next visit to Seattle.",3
633,633,"Mediocre at best First time in seattle and choose to stay at CP since I have platinum priority club status. Never again. My status meant very little. They placed me in a regular room which was dirty, small and had a terrible odor. At that point I insisted on an upgrade and was given a club floor room. Club access is not on par with other CPs. Great views but food was so so and booze came at a fee. The hotel nickel and dimes you for everything including wifi. Elevators were also very hard to come by, had to leave 10 minutes early to get downstairs in order not to be late. The only redeeming aspect of the hotel was the location, otherwise it is very overpriced and terrible value.",2
634,634,"Worst Hotel Experience Ever We booked a nonsmoking room online several weeks in advance of our stay at the Crowne Plaza in downtown Seattle. Upon our arrival, the front desk staff asked if we would consider a smoking room. This was completely unacceptable to my family and we clearly stated that no, we would not consider a smoking room due mainly out of concern for our infant daughter's health. This particular staff member went to speak quietly with another front desk staff member and they both agreed on a particular room for us. When we entered the room, the smell of cigarette smoke was very apparent, and yet we could not imagine that the front desk staff would intentionally put us in a smoking room without informing us. Two days later, we discovered an ashtray and matches and checked with the front desk to discover that in fact we had been put in a smoking room intentionally because they had not kept our reserved nonsmoking room for us. All our clothes and other belongings as well as our baby reeked of cigarette smoke.In addition to this appalling lack of concern for our health and wishes, our room was not serviced during our three night stay. When I asked the front desk manager why our room had not been serviced, he checked with housekeeping and informed me that we had had a do not disturb tag on our door so they did not disturb us. This was not the case (the tag was on the inside of our door the entire time) and I had anxiously been awaiting staff to empty our garbage of dirty diapers and replace our towels. The front desk manager offered us the pathetic compensation of a complimentary hotel breakfast for my family being exposed to carcinogenic cigarette fumes for days and not having our rooms cleaned. This was our first and will definitely be our last stay at any Crowne Plaza Hotel.",1
635,635,"Not Happy, never going back! We booked our reservations 6 months in advance. 34th floor/view/2 double beds. When we arrived our room wasn't available so they put us on the 27th floor with no view. Also I had to request that I not be charged the 34th floor rate (as it was more). Also, didn鈥檛 receive our 鈥減ackaged鈥?continental breakfast. Later that night we went down to the hotel lounge to check out the live music. After paying $35.00 for 4 drinks (and not so great drinks at that, and the service was less than expected) we were chased out and followed to the elevator- the waiter telling us we stiffed him on his tip. Guess he wanted more. Came right up to my face and said this in front of other guests.Not going back.... Because when on a vacation- I don't feel like being attacked over not giving enough tip. I guess I'll stick with the Westin!",1
636,636,"Good as always... Myself, my husband and my son went to Seattle for a couple of Mariner's games. We've stayed at the Crown Plaza before for Seahawks games, so we were comfortable with what we booked. We had a suite with a queen-size fold out couch in the living room and a king-size bed in the bedroom.Everything was very clean and the beds are so comfortable with their down duvets and mattress covers. We needed extra pillows for my son and the front desk was very quick to bring them to the room.The Regatta Lounge had some wonderful live jazz music and the drinks and food are very tastey.The location of the hotel is very central and everything is just a small walk or cab ride away.This hotel is great for families and couples alike.",5

638,638,"Seattle's Crowne Plaza- a great homebase for exploring downtown I treated my husband to a weekend getaway and paid just $79 per night - a rate special that I found through Travelzoo. As a Priority Club member (which you can join at no charge on the web), you can ask for a room upgrade on check-in, which I did. We were upgraded to a city view room on the 30th floor with a king size bed, and with all the amenities described in previous reviews. All of the service staff were friendly and helpful; the concierge called shortly after our late afternoon check-in to ask if we needed any dinner reservations, recommendations, anything she could help with as she was finishing her workday at 6 pm. The valet parking is expensive, $27 for 24 hours, but you can come and go as many times as you like. Yes, you can find a cheaper day rate elsewhere, but we didn't see any lots in the area that charged less than $22 for 24 hours. There is so much to explore within walking distance from the Crowne Plaza, we just left the car with the valet all weekend. We ate breakfast in the hotel both mornings. The service was good but the food was mediocre. And given that Seattle is home to Starbucks and many other coffee suppliers, the coffee was dreadful. There are surprisingly few restaurants that serve breakfast close by that aren't in hotels, and at least by eating at ours it was convenient and fast. This hotel is very well located for exploring downtown-wonderful window and high end shopping, and bargain shopping at Nordstrums Rack and Ross. It only takes about 15-20 minutes to walk to the Space Needle and Seattle Centre where Experience Music Project, the Aquarium, and Science Centre are located. Exploring EMP can take an entire day, especially now that there is a new Science Fiction Museum there. One evening we went to Teatro Zinzanni, a circus/KitKat Club- style dinner theatre that was really entertaining. This tent theatre is also near the Space Needle, just a $5 cab ride from the hotel and a pleasant walk back. I would definitely stay at the Crowne Plaza again for location, good service and really comfy beds.",4

640,640,"Great Hotel at a Great Price Even though only one of our three requests were met, we still had a great experience at the Crowne Plaza booking through Hotwire. The staff was friendly and efficient, the room was great, and the location of the hotel made it extremely accesible to all of Seattle's highlights. I couldn't see myslef paying $150 a night for this room, but through Hotwire, $73 was more than acceptable. The only negatives; I understand parking is ridiculous in downtown Seattle, but the $27 valet parking fee should be made clear when making the reservation. As for the requests we made; We wanted a non-smoking room but wound up with smoking. Not too bad though considering the smell was not very noticeable. Our friends who stayed in the inter-connecting room next door (our only request that was granted) were not as lucky. They are non-smokers as well, but the room they were in was definately not. My friend's girlfriend actually got a headache because the stench was so overpowering. (The hotel allowed them to switch to a non-smoking room for the second night of their stay.) The last request that was denied was not too big of a deal. My lady and I wanted one queen bed, but ended up in a room with two doubles. We remedied this by pushing both of them together. All in all I was happy with our stay at Crowne Plaza. I would recommend booking through hotwire if you are the kind of person that can go with the flow even if not getting exactly what you request, i.e. non-smoking, # of beds, etc. The money we saved on the room allowed us to be less frugal when enjoying downtown Seattle.",4
641,641,"Close to Convention Center Just stayed at the Seattle Crowne Plaza from Feb 11-13. We got a great rate of $65/night through Hotwire. We checked in on Saturday afternoon at around 1pm. We got a room on the 23rd floor, directly across from the Elevators. However, we didn't really hear too much noise from the hallways or elevators because the air conditioning was pretty loud and covered the outside noise. We had a 2 double bed room, with a nice view of I-5. My son loved the view because he could see the cars on the freeway. We asked for a King Bed, but the lady at the front desk said they didn't have any available. I'm also wondering if people who book through Hotwire get the rooms by the elevators? Because my mom also was assigned a room by the elevator and she booked through Hotwire. The room itself was pretty spacious. Enough room for my 2 1/2 year old son to play with his toys. However, the bathroom was pretty tiny. The shower was regular sized and with good water pressure. Conditioning shampoo, mouthwash, lotion, and facial soap were supplied. Crowne Plaza does try to add some little details we noticed in the room. Upon arrival, there is a little red bag filled with ear plugs, eye mask and linen spray on the bed. Also, a CD with soft music. In the bathroom there was also a nightlight and on the curtains there was a clip to keep the light out. Very nice touch. The beds were decent. The room was quite dry and we all had a hard to sleeping because our throats became very dry.The main reason we were in Seattle was to visit the Northwest Flower  Garden Show held at the Convention Center. The hotel was in a very good location. We were able to walk through Freeway Park and end up directly on the 4th floor entrance to the Convention Center in about 5-10 minutes. Pacific Place Shopping Center is about 5 blocks away, WestLake is about 7 blocks away and Pike Place is about 10 blocks. Walking around at night was a little scary because there are a lot of homeless people and also a lot of people who were smoking weed and begging for money. It didn't exactly feel safe. During the day it was OK.There is no self-parking in the hotel. Only Valet service. It was quite expensive at $27/night. We did notice a public parking lot up one block for $12/day.Overall, we had a nice stay at Crowne Plaza. I would stay there again if I got the Hotwire rate.",4
642,642,A Great Weekend       27th floor,4
643,643,"Wonderful Seattle Hotel! The Crowne Plaza was a wonderful hotel with top notch service. Nothing went wrong while we were there, everything was perfect. Check-in was a breeze. We took an airport shuttle which dropped us off directly in front of the hotel. We were checked in immediately with a very nice front office employee. The lobby was very well kept and very cozy. The room we had was on the 30th floor with an awesome view of downtown Seattle, including the space needle and the water..picture perfect. The room was very spacious and had 2 extremely comfortable double beds. There was a desk, sitting chair, big armoire with tv, coffee maker and safe. The bathroom was of decent size with plenty of space to put things. Every room is near an elevator which is a plus. There are 4 elevators, which worked just fine and we never had to wait long. The location of the hotel is perfect, a short stoll to everything in Downtown. It's about a 5-10 minute walk to the water, as well as multiple shops and malls etc. Seattle is such a beautiful city and you can see a lot just by walking through downtown. A block or so away was the Seattle Libabry, which was amazing. The place is enormous. The hotel has a nice bar with a good happy hour. We ate breakfast one morning in the restaurant, which had a buffet which is small yet has everything one would need to have a good meal, inlcuding cook to order omletes and waffles. Service throughout the stay was great, including the concierge who was very helpful. We called one evening for some towels and in less than 5 minutes, we had them! I would recommdend this hotel to anyone who visits Seattle, you will enjoy it!",5
644,644,great- had one bad experience this was a great hotel- i went with my dad and we had a perfectly nice room but the first night the people across the hall were drunk all night and noisy! but no one did anything about itluckily the next night they checked out and the rest of the time was fineit was a bit high up from the centralized downtown but that ensured it for being more quiet and a nice walk the view was spectacular!perfect place to stay!,4
645,645,"The place to stay in Seattle I stayed four nights due to a conference and had a couple of lodging options. Based on the TripAdvisor feedback, I chose this hotel of the four or five that were offered. I'm glad I did. Comparing my experience to that of my fellow conference attendees, I made the right choice.The front desk was always helpful. The valet parking was very quick. The elevators were fast. The hotel's resturant was good (I ate in the bar 3 of the 4 nights). The room was enormous, clean and comfortable. Great chair and desk. Great bed, sheets, comforter, etc. Big comfortable bathroom. Good wireless internet connection. Huge windows  incredible view of downtown  the Space Needle. When you open the door the first time it was breath taking. I was on the 25th floor with southern exposure.One gripe ... only a handful of television stations came in clearly, but I never called the front desk so there may have been an easy solution to that. Another gripe ... I got stuck next to the elevators. Again, I never complained and it only presented a problem early one morning.My two small gripes aside, this is the place to stay when in Seattle.",5
646,646,"Very nice stay I stayed at this hotel in early June. I arrived very early in the morning but was checked in immediately.My room was clean and well-kept. Comfortable bed. The airporter shuttle bus stops right across the street for people who are not driving themselves. I was attending meetings at other locations so did not dine at the Crowne Plaza, but my stay was just fine.",3
647,647,"Handy hotel for doing Seattle We stayed here for 5 nights in July and found the hotel to be in a great location and to a decent standard.The kids loved the 31st floor view - right over to the Space Needle. The beds were incredibly comfortable and the room spacious and well equipped.One tip - pay the extra for an executive room. The difference when we booked was only a few dollars but with the executive room you get access to the executive floors and to a little breakfast room with complimentary coffee, juice, muffins, bagels etc in the mornings. This was just the sort of breakfast to appeal to kids - and it was very pleasant to sip your coffee and look out over the Seattle skyline.Only tiny glitch was at check-in. We arrived at the hotel at around 6.30pm after a 10 hour flight from Dublin (bear in mind that this was 02.30am for us!) to be told that our room wasn't ready. However, after fixing the receptionist with a hard stare and explaining that, with a jet-lagged 6 year old in tow, waiting around simply wasn't an option, a room was rustled up!",4
648,648,A very nice experience We had 4 nights at the Crowne Plaza and were totally happy. The suite was very nice with the bed being one of the best ever. The sleep package they give you is a nice plus. I was a little nervous about the hotel being at the top of the hill but it wasn't as bad as expected. It is so near great restaurants and shopping. The walk down to water is easy. The walk back up is tough but we took cabs if we were down by the water. The hotel staff were very friendly and always said hello in elevators and around the hotel. The concierge staff helped us greatly and were very nice. The valet parkers were efficient and always had the car up in due time. We never ate in the hotel because we wanted to eat in regular restaurants but the lounge was very nice with nice waitstaff. Of course it is not a 4/5 star hotel but we had a 5 star experience overall and would return anytime.,5
649,649,"Great home base for a one day Seattle tour! We (my wife, two children, and I) had 24 hours in Seattle last week. This was planned on short notice so I tried to find a deal for a room, but didn't have much time to do my homework. I ended up booking a room for about $100 on Hotwire after bidding unsuccessfully for a 3 star on Priceline. Our flight into Seattle arrived very early (8am) on a Tuesday morning, and we were in our rental car in downtown Seattle by 10am; I didn't want to cruise blindly through town, so I thought I would just park the car at the hotel and check in later in the afternoon and we could walk around downtown.As I pulled up to the valet parking attendant at the front door, I had the bellman grab our bags and I headed to the front desk to get registered. The desk clerk was very courteous, and said that she had a room ready if we would like to have our bags brought up to the room now...I was very pleasantly surprised, as all three employees to this point were very friendly and courteous, and treated me as a valued guest. We went up to our room, which was on the 22nd floor and facing south; great view of the other downtown skyscrapers, but facing away from the Puget Sound and Space Needle. Oh well, we weren't planning on spending much time in the room. I flopped on the bed for a few minutes while the others were getting ready and I noticed that the bed was extremely comfortable, one of the best I have encountered in many hotel stays over the past 10 years. The room was very clean, the furnishings were a little dated but in nice shape, and there was plenty of room for the four of us to spread out. Although the room was directly above Interstate 5, and the hotel provided a kit including ear plugs and other (non-drug) aids to sleep, the noise was not very audible from our room.The location of this hotel is perfect if you plan on just doing downtown Seattle; we walked down to the Public Market (Pike Street), to the Westlake Monorail station, then down to Pioneer Square. The hotel was pretty much central to all of these attractions (a little further south, but still walkable, are the baseball and football stadiums).The only time I felt like we were being taken was the valet parking fee of $25, but that is pretty much standard in the larger downtown hotels now. I feel like the 24 hours we spent in Seattle at the Crowne Plaza was truly a bargain, and I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to friends, especially if you can work a deal on Hotwire or equivalent.",4
650,650,"Consistently Bad Service I recently spent a week at the Crowne Plaza in Seattle. It was my first experience at this hotel and at this chain. First the good. The price was good for Seattle in the Summertime. The room was clean and the housekeeping staff were quite charming. In fact, they were the good part of the hotel. The location is also good for seeing the beautiful public library and much of downtown. Now the bad. Although the woman who checked me in was very nice and very professional the overall behavior of the desk is quite unbelievable for a hotel. They show absolutely no interest in their guests. It was almost as if having guests is annoying to them. Ask a question and they look down and ignore you. Stand in line to check out and they help the last person in line first. When the elevator door or any door opens, watch out because they will make sure they get through first. It was if the guests are in the way. This was a daily occurence for me for 7 days. Parking is unusual in that you have to valet park. They were typically short staffed and you had to wait some time to get your car. It was not uncommon to show up to get your car and find a line of people upset with the wait.",2
651,651,"parking is a problem, otherwise very good       View of the Crown Plaza (rust colored building) from the 73rd floor of the Bank of America...",4
652,652,"A good price for Downtown Seattle, great location While I prefer smaller, more eclectic hotels, we needed accommodations in downtown Seattle near the Smith Tower, where my son was throwing his 40th birthday party, having reserved the restaurant on the top floor of the tower for the occasion. Crown Plaza was a few blocks from the Tower, straight up hill. Walking distance to Pike's Place Market, well-located for our purposes. The price was reasonable, compared to comparable hotels downtown. Service was good and our 30th floor room had a nice view of the the Water and of the space needle. No street noise, but giggly teen-age girls' noise was a problem from the adjoining room. Great beds, comfortable, spacious room.Not all rooms have refrigerators, which seemed strange to me. The service in the restaurant was indeed slow, and the price expensive for breakfast. Send the coffee back to the kitchen if it is as bad as ours was.I'd certainly stay there again, considering the prices for other hotels in downtown Seattle. However, be prepared to be kinicked for every little amenity, which I find annoying, when you're already paying $175 a night for the room. For example, $.75 per day is added to your bill each weekday of your stay for USA Today, unless you opt out of the delivery. I'm used to staying in hotels where a morning newspaper is complimentary.",4
653,653,"Good deal at a bargain price We paid half what the hotel website was asking through Hotwire making this a good deal. The hotel is nice enough -- warranting the 3 and 1/2 stars. There wasn't an in-room refrigerator and the vending machine only took credit cards. (!) The on-site gift shop had a fine selection of snacks and cold drinks and was open 7am-10pm.We weren't bothered by the noise and the staff was very accomodating. I was able to do an early check-in and a late check-out. Warning... it's at the TOP of a hill if you are walking. I'm glad I didn't have a car, I would have hated the $25 parking charge.",4
654,654,"Clean and comfortable Nice hotel. Liked the white linens, our room was clean and the bed was firm. We were happy with the location, walked to Pikes Market and to the tram to the Space Needle. No problem with noise. We had 4 rooms for a family gathering, and one of them was lucky enough to have a beautiful view of the Space Needle.",4

656,656,"Not bad... clean, comfy and friendly This is a good average hotel. If you are looking for something ritzy, this isn't the place. But for a decent view, higher than motel expectation but can't afford the Ritz type of hotel, this place is not bad.As with most hotels downtown, the parking is valet only at $25. It's better than trying to have to park on the street. The room was very clean and everyone was courteous and friendly, from front desk to valet.",4
657,657,"Great Deal We got a great deal through hot-wire for this hotel. The hotel is in a great location, we walked everywhere. We usually stay at Westin's, and love their heavenly beds, but this bed blew theirs away. The room was a little small, but had all the amenities we needed and was nicely decorated. The staff were friendly and helpful. We will definately stay here again on our next visit to Seattle.",4

660,660,"Found great value and views at the Crowne Plaza I happened onto a great value for two nights at the Crowne Plaza Seattle Downtown through Priceline. (The Best Western Pioneer Square also had a great 3-day deal but was farther from downtown.) Crowne Plaza's room was spacious, clean and well appointed with a soft, comfy bed like Sheraton. Great view overlooking a park and skyscrapers all around. Rainier Square shopping very close. Hotel's happy hour had terrific hors d'oeuvres and wine, very reasonably priced. I walked to Pike Place Market and the Washington State Ferries, but note that it rains frequently and the hills are about as formidable as San Francisco's. Airport bus stops every half-hour across the street. I would gladly stay again at the Crowne Plaza Seattle.",4
661,661,"OK for auction price/deal This was OK for the price. Bought through Hotwire for $70. Hotel 3 stars at best. Location very good, just not great. Service fair. The room was very comfortable, great bed - nice view of the Space Needle. Overall - I loved being downtown for this price, and the bed was super. Room just OK, parking a rip-off at $25 bucks. I would stay there again for this price but would never pay list.",3
662,662,"Clean, comfortable, convenient We stayed two nights at the Crowne Plaza in downtown Seattle. It's a more-than-adequate hotel, not fancy but very clean and comfortable.Rooms: We stayed in a King bed room that had a lovely view of Interstate 5. (OK, you could also see First Hill, Beacon Hill, and areas south.) The room itself was average size but well organized, with a king bed, work desk, and lounging chair. Decor was a cut above the standard tackiness of middling hotels. Bathroom was a good size, not fancy but very clean. The room itself was spotless.Location: Great location in downtown Seattle, close to shopping, restaurants, Capital Hill, the waterfront, and freeway access.Amenities: We didn't go to the restaurant, so I can't really comment on it. The gift shop had a few basic (and expensive) necessities. The exercise room is tiny - fine if you're going to get on the treadmill or stationary bike. There are a few basic universal-gym type machines as well, but not suitable for a real workout.Service: Service was prompt and attentive. Valet parking was very quick. $25/night parking in Seattle is a bit tough to swallow. OK, it's not $40 like it is in San Francisco, but still pretty steep.If you want a clean comfortable room in a good location, this should meet your needs. If you're looking for 1st-class service, luxury, or lots of amenities, you will probably be disappointed. For what we paid (a reduced rate through hotwire), it was a bargain. At the rack rate, it would be adequate.",4
663,663,"mediocre, for the price... at best. First of all, the room we had booked was in the executive/club floors rooms above floor 30. I hadn't been informed of the floor when I booked but I did notice the lack of a small refidgerator when we arrived at our room. I was told that there would be one so I had bought some perishable fruit that would need refidgeration.Our next clue was when the toilet overflowed on the first flush. We called to have it taken care of, the attendant plunging and plunging for 5 minutes straight, then telling me...it works now, but it flushes very slowOn the next foray to the toilet, as you can guess, it didn't flust at all. Immediately I requested another room and was given one on the 31st floor*.*executive/club floors 31 and upMy new room had a small fridge with the promised contents.The toilet in the new room still had problems flushing.My wife took a bath and when she finished it took the tub a full 15 minutes to drain... Hmmmm.Horrible food at the menu price of $29 per person (although we had a coupon that the staff of the regata grille never seemed to have seen before that entitled us to this buffet for free) for a seafood buffet on friday night. The saturday morning breakfast buffet made me sick. Undercooked sausage and bacon...cold eggs (again a coupon which came with our room package)This package deal amounted to $278 for a one night stay.Without the food coupons, the one night stay was to be $159I would never stay in this wanna-be hotel again but if I did I would never get the food dealThe room was nowhere NEAR worth $159The view was magnificent.The staff were very nice and accomodating.Needless to say this was a big disappointment. For that kind of money.",2
664,664,"Not a good trip, watch hidden fees We stayed on the 33rd floor and we were next to the elevator so everytime we were about to fall asleep, we would hear a hydraulic sound. it was very anoying. Another problem was the damn hidden fees, they charged us $25 a night for tax and another $25 a night for parking our rent a car. We went there for Monday night Football. Did not have a good stay, but the Cowboys won.....great football game.",2
665,665,"lazy management My family stayed here in November 2004 for two nights. We were kept up past 2 AM by loud and obnoxious partiers in the next room. We complained to the front desk the following day. The second night, the pounding, yelling and fighting intensified. It even moved into the hall by our door. We called the manager and he said he couldn't kick anybody out unless more than one party complained! We felt unsafe and unheard by the management. This was not an environment we were comfortable bringing our children into.",2
666,666,"Do not stay here. I have had the worse experience with this hotel than any other I've stayed at. Firstly, they charged my bill for parking and internet charges that I never made. Secondly, during my 3 week stay there, they started major renovations on the floor above us without ever having the courtesy of giving us a heads up, so to speak. I am with the national tour of a show, our schedule involves late nights so I tend to sleep in later, but jackhammering at 8:30 in the morning on a Sunday was inexcusable. To add insult to injury, the day before I was to check out, they started the renovations in on my floor! By the time I was leaving the hotel, I was stepping over plywood and furniture and torn down peices of wall paper to get out. THIS IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION. The hotel manager was completely unappologetic and rude, and I got a bill from them a month later charging me for some dinners they accidentaly billed to another bill. This is after they already charged me wrongly for the parking and highspeed. The management there is a complete and utter pathetic mess. I couldn't bring myself to follow up because I just wanted to forget the whole thing. Don't stay here, it 's not worth it.",1
667,667,great location ! Good location for walking all over Seattle; especially convenient for games at Qwest or Safeco parks. Room was spacious and modern; we even had a view of the Space Needle among all of the tall buildings ! Rooms next to the elevator have been soundproofed.

668,668,Crowne Plaza-a good experience We stayed at the Crowne Plaza on 8/22/04 and 8/29/04 and had a very pleasant experience. We arrived a few hours early and our room was ready so we got ourselves settled and went out to explore the city.Our room was very clean and the heavenly beds and little extras they put into the Priority Club suites made our night very restful. We were impressed that the Priority Club members had our own breakfast buffet in a lounge on our floors.We found the staff to be pleasant and helpful and would definitely go back.,5
669,669,"Very good hotel for what we paid My fiance and I recently stayed for four nights at this hotel and we were quite impressed. We got a great price from Hotwire so we were quite lucky with that. The hotel was really nice and it was very clean. We walked in the hotel and we were checked in and in our room within 5 minutes. We had no problems and we were treated very well by the staff. The location is also good because it's pretty much in the middle of everything whether you're there for shopping, sightseeing, or buisness. If you can get a good price for the hotel we highly recommend it. We will gladly stay here again if we get the chance.",5
670,670,"Satisfactory Stay We stayed at this hotel on a night prior to an Alaskan cruise. We won this hotel on Hotwire for approx. $120. We arrived a little early, but we were given a room immediately (a corner room with two windows rather than the standard one window). The staff was very friendly. The room was comfortable in size and clean. The bed slept heavenly, and the restaurant was very good. Also, the location was good--close to shopping, the Market, and fairly close to the Space Needle. The decoration of the room was modern rather than the traditional decoration of many luxury hotels. While this hotel is what I would consider to be a good hotel, I would only give it a 3.5 or 4 stars out of 5.",4

Good things are that it is clean and has a pretty good loacation. you can walk anywhere in the city easily. waterfront, safeco field, union lake, capital hill, and the seattle center are all easy to walk to. if you are looking for a hotel in the absolute heart of the action, i recommend the Sheraton. However, the Crowne is only a few blocks away. Watch out for the elevators though, they are extremely slow, so allow 5 minutes more time waiting for one of the four elevators. it has 34 floors, but only 15 rooms on each floor.

689,689,great for the self-sufficient traveller       Inn at Queen Anne from the top of the Space Needle,4
690,690,A hotel entirely without a chain-hotel feel...       Inn at Q Anne,4
691,691,"""QUAINT"" is not the same as ""RUNDOWN"" My son and I decided to celebrate his graduation from High School with a trip to Seattle. We chose the Inn at Queen Anne because of its proximity to the Experience Music Project, The Space Needle and the funky shops and eateries nearby. The hotel was described as quaint and the pictures on the hotel website were nice, so we gave it a shot.Upon entering the hotel we were greeted with the carpet in the lobby , filthy and torn. Uh-oh, I thought, not a good sign. The front desk had overbooked and even though we had paid for and confirmed our reservations for late arrival 2 weeks prior, they only had one room left with 2 beds. We took it and hurriedly left our things in the room to go grab a quick bite. Upon returning and getting into bed I noticed that the room had no A/C, the windows would not open and that my son's double bed was clean, however the twin they put me in had hairy sheets and was in a former closet. I am not talking about an old fashioned wall pull-out bed-this was actually a tiny twin bed stuffed in a closet. I went into the kitchenette to put my leftovers in the fridge and the fridge had mold in it and did not work. I went to the desk to complain, was told there was nothing that could be done, so we sucked it up and tried to sleep. I took the sheets of my bed and used my sons blanket, but eventually the closet got so stuffy I jumped into my sons bed that at least had a fan above it. In the morning we experienced plumbing issues with the toilet and shower and bugs in the bathroom. Upon packing up I looked under the bed to make sure we got everything and discovered possessions from someone who had stayed there before we did. The housekeepers did not clean under the beds or change the sheets. We canceled the rest of our stay and decided to leave Seattle and drove to Anacortes where we stayed at the Cap Sante' Inn- which was a palace compared to where we had been the night before.I wrote to the manager of the Queen Anne requesting a refund. I received a letter back saying a refund could not be given, however they gave me a coupon to stay again. As if I would ever use it. The word Quaint that Queen Anne uses in their advertising is not the same as Rundown.My advice to anybody staying there, upon check in go to the room, give it the white glove inspection and make sure everything is in working order before you agree to stay in it.By the way, the Queen Anne had a policy that if you reserve the room they charge your card immediately and will not give a refund without 72 hours advance cancellation. Ridiculous.",1
692,692,"Okay Stay at Inn at Queen Anne The Inn at Queen Anne is in a great location, however I found the rooms to be a bit dark, crowded and outdated. The bathroom was really small and it could have used an upgrade. The staff, however, was fantastic. They were really helpful with recommending restaurants and helping us check out at 4 am.",3
693,693,"charming The staff was friendly and helpful, almost to a fault. Great location if your going to seattle center or key arena. easy to get downtown from there als. the room homey, with its creaks and squeeks and leaks.. had a fridge and a stove. I will stay here while in seattle again..",4
694,694,"Comfortable apt.-style hotel Enjoyable stay for the price and amenities. It's European-style hotel. The building is old, but the furniture is classic style and comfortable. No A/C on upper floors, but able to open windows. Terrific grocery nearby (metropolitan market) and good restaurants as well. Next to Seattle Center (Space Needle, Experience Music Project, Science Center). Far from Pike Market and Waterfront, but Inn shuttle is available during the day. Parking is very tight. There are limited hotel spaces, but you can usually find parking along the street for a fee for 1-2 hours. Parking after 6 p.m. is free on the streets, but you have to move the car by 8 amReported a slow toilet, but it was fixed immediately. Staff is responsive.",4
695,695,"Clean and functional Overall, based on the previous reviews, we were pleasantly surprised. The room was clean, and the walk-in closet and kitchenette were nice bonuses. The staff was ridiculously nice and helpful. However, the location was only so-so--far from downtown, though the neighborhood itself had some nice bars and restaurants and the proximity to the space needle was kind of neat. The continental breakfast was pretty sparse, and the mattress was the opposite of comfortable. The shower was more appropriate for guests under five feet tall. The price was right, so we would stay there again, but it's not the kind of place in which we want to hang out a lot in the room.",3
696,696,"Charming, cheap hotel Stayed here just under a week in July 2008 and was a little wary considering some of the reviews but really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is a little tatty in places, and if you're looking for a high end hotel then this is not for you, but for the price what you get is amazing! Rooms are large and although the decor isnt great the place was clean and secure. We had a kitchenette in our room complete with cooking utenstils, a small table, fridge etc. a walk in closet (!!!) and ensuite bathroom. Bathroom was quite small, but served its purpose well. Toiletries were supplied, it was kept clean with towels etc and we had no problems with hot water or pressure during our stay. The hotel is lovely to look at from the outside, and has a little garden where you can take your breakfast in the am. Breakfast is nothing fancy and DIY (7.30 - 10) but again, great for what you pay. They had toast, juices, tea, coffee, and muffins for you to help yourself to. Great location, near to space needle, safe and buses and restaurants nearby. Market across street if you're cooking, otherwise pubs, diners, a thai place, an indian and some nice bars all within a few blocks as well as shops and services. Free shuttle is helpful, but timed and not always going where you want, but we managed to use it a few times but you do need to book ahead. Staff at the hotel were brilliant - really friendly and helpful. No lift/elevator though if you struggle walking.",5
697,697,"Reasonable, clean and great location. What more can you ask for! I was reading reviews of Queen Ann because I will be back in Seattle for my second visit. Last time, about 6 yrs ago, I found this hotel to be just as it is being described now. That means I'll be going back for another stay.Thanks to all those who take the time to contribute to these forums and make travel easier for the rest of us.",4
698,698,"Not a Bad Place to Stay - Short Term First of all, don't expect much. If you want roominess, amenities or cannot walk up stairs, this is NOT the place for you.If you are out and about all day and just need a place to sleep and shower, this is a fine place. Our rate was good, compared to other lodgings in the city.It is an old (1920's built) twin apartment buildings for retired priests and nuns. One building for the sisters, the other for the priests.Our room had a queen bed, large walk-in closet, kitchenette and bath. It was clean and adequate for our three night stay.The staff was friendly and the bellboy..Adam...was very nice and helpful. The stairway had a funny smell (mildew like) and the room had no air conditioner (but some do) and no smell. The temps hit 90 while we were there, but the open windows and ceiling fan made it bearable. also, hot temperature in Seattle are rare.This is across the street from City Center (the old 1962 Worlds Fair site) with the space needle, park and amusement rides only a short walk away. The monorail is still there and for $2 you get a ride downtown. From there you can walk, or take free public transportations, to Pioneer Square or Pike's Markey, or waterfront.If you are arriving by air and during a rush-hour period I suggest you let the hotel book you a towncar. It is $45 plus tip, but a taxi ride during rush-hour may be more expensive. We were stuck in traffic so it is nice not to have a meter. We went back via taxi at 5 a.m. on a Sunday and it cost $35 plus tip.",4
699,699,"Its not the Ritz, but its not bad either... I almost didnt book the Inn based on reviews here, but I am glad I did. The location alone is worth the cost of the room. It is in the heart of Lower Queen Anne with plenty of choices for food, drink and entertainment all within less than a 5 minute walk. Of course as with any big city, there are street people around and if that bothers you I suggest only staying in the suburbs or staying home. I always felt safe and comfortable. Many families and europeans were staying here during my stay as well as a few retirees. The rooms are rather basic, they could probably be remodeled and it would make a huge difference but for a 100 year old building designed for retired clergy its all ok. The bed was decent, not great, didnt hurt my back. There was a small kitchenette and a large closet. The bathroom was tiny and there was no place to set your toiletries except the toilet. The tv worked and there was a small a/c unit for the three days a year it gets hot in Seattle. You have to pay for parking or park on the street and get up early to feed the meter.  All in all I would defininitely stay here again. The hotel is very European in that it is old, small, basic and full of character. If you require sparkling fixtures and everything brand new, you should probably stay elsewhere. If you love the city and everything the urban landscape has to offer, you would be foolish to stay elsewhere.",4
700,700,"hot and smelly Overpriced, stuffy, weird smelling room. Advertised shuttle never seemed to be available...",1
701,701,"Good location, great staff. The rooms etc. have been described well enough by others, so I won't repeat. I generally use my hotel rooms only to sleep in, have a shower etc., so my expectations are easily met. It was quiet, had some charm (unlike many other pricer places I have stayed this year) and had a very friendly and helpful staff. The free wireless access was a big plus as well.The free wine tasting on the eve of my arrival was a very nice touch - not one I've run into at all elsewhere, and a good PR move by management. The rooms were as I expected from previous reviews, and there were no unpleasant surprises. Having a fridge, sink and stove were more than I required, although I did make use of that fridge!It's a good location, lots of nearby restaurants, a grocery store, liquor store and so on. The sights of the city are easily reached from there as well.",4
702,702,"Old and Rustic with some Charm Well we just got back this eve. The hotel is ok if you just need a place to sleep for the night that is cheap . The room was clean but not large. We had water in our carpet from a leak in the heater. The heater is a old radiator,that we could not get to shut off , and we were on the bottom floor in room 153 .So we could not leave the windows open at night . Yes there is a small kitchen . . The hotel is next to the liquor store so a few bums sat out side our window waiting for the store to open . The best part of our trip was the door man Adam . There service is very good , as they really try hard with what they have to work with . Adam made our stay and was really help full . . The shuttle runs on a time frame . So if you need to take it, you have to plan ahead .The hotel is old and a bit worn , so dont expect the Hilton . Good Luck .",2

704,704,"If longer than just a night- go somewhere else.. I never wrote a review on here before but after a long trip up the pacific coast - thought I should add my thoughts on a few places. The inn at queen anne was by far the worst place we stayed. There are not any huge problems- like bedbugs- but there are a lot of little annoying things like no elevator, breakfast of just english muffins and machine juice, no coffee maker or hairdryer in the room, etc.. The hotel staff appears friendly but cant say there are helpful. For instance, we had to use their parking ($15 per night)- the desk girl gave my husband horrible directions and he parked in the wrong lot and got a ticket. Becareful what you ask for here too- they told us they had cribs available- even though our baby sleeps in our bed we thought we would take it if its available- at the end of our stay we realized we paid $15 per day for the crib- which isnt a lot- just wish they would have mentioned the cost when offered. The neighborhood is okay- some restaurants, lots of bars, lots of homeless, close to the touristy things. The hotel isnt aweful for a night- or two but if you stay longer- I am sure you can find something nicer in Seattle.",1
705,705,"Lovely hotel - nice location This hotel is in a great location and a few mins walk to the Seattle centre and Space Needle. It has very friendly staff. The staff at the reception were very helfpul - from providing help with our luggage to assisting us with directions to the attractions. We reached the hotel quite late in the night, around 11:30pm and the staff member (Rorth) happily asssited us with the luggage. We stayed for 2 nights and it was five of us travelling together. The hotel managed to give us two good sized rooms on the same floor. The hotel also provided free shuttle service into the downtown and also to the pier from where we boarded our cruise. There is also a complimentary breakfast that constitute of tea/coffee, toast, fruit juices, croissants, and other pasteries. There is also free internet access in all the rooms which was very convenient indeed. The staff - Rorth, Dana, Jessica were so helpful that a special thanks need to go to them. I would definitely stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to anyone who don't want to spend too much time at the hotel.",5
706,706,Excellent Stay Staff were friendly and helpful. Nice hotel for the price. There are a few supermarkets and restaurants in close proximity. ideal location for Space Needle. Breakfast included is an added bonus. Rooms were big and spacious. Overall a nice experience and relaxing.,4
707,707,"Charming! Charming and quaint hotel. Quiet and with a fun history. The staff was outstanding, the rooms were small but clean and interesting. Nice little getaway!",4
708,708,"Loud! As a Seattleite, I was looking for a pleasant night in the city. The Inn at Queen Anne is what it is. A cool, 30's era apartment building (with a courtyard) that has been converted into a hotel. Price is good. For Seattle $90 a night is pretty unheard of . Now the down side. THE WALLS AND DOORS ARE SO THIN YOU CAN HEAR YOUR NEIGHBORS COUGH! I was awaken at 11:45pm, on a Sunday night, by the guests across the hall , returning from apparently a night out in Seattle. A group of about 20 people massed in one room for about 2 hours. I called the front desk, and the clerk's response was how loud are they being? Gimme a break! Loud enough to wake me up! The clerk did come up and ask the group to quiet it down, and a few people left the room, but I could still hear the loud, inconsiderate drunk tourists. I ended up going to work the next morning with about 3 hours of sleep. I did like the old kitchenette however.",2
709,709,"expect charm  This hotel is NOT for anyone who actually appreciates the sterility, anonymity,  tiresome consistency of a big-box hotel!The room furnishings are simple but tasteful, the bathrooms are small and showers sufficient but far from luxurious, the closets are enormous, the windows actually open, and the old-fashioned hot-water radiators quietly gurgle and clank. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. The location is fantastic. We will recommend the Inn at Queen Anne to all our friends.",4
710,710,"Don't stay here! I initially researched the Inn @ QA on Expedia and found a $74 rate. I contacted the reservation agent directly and asked if she could match the rate. She said the lowest she could offer (AAA) was $80. I accepted to allow more flexible cancellation options. We arrived at 10: 15 p.m. on a Saturday. We were offered a first floor or second floor room, (We were cautioned both faced a noisy first Avenue.) We chose the second floor even after being told there was no elevator. We were not offered help with our bags.We arrived to find a small room (converted from apartment studio - kitchenette) with stifling heat from a radiator. We dialed the front desk fro 15 minutes to no answer (hoping for advice on turning down teh radiator) We finally noticed a note to turn the knob. This had little effect. The bed was firm and outfitted with scratchy sheets. The television received cable channels somewhat clearly but local ones were very 'cloudy.' When using the toilet one had to contort to the left to avoid a stack pipe which was very hot. The highly praised Continental breakfast was weak with watery coffee, poorly mixed juices and a varaiety of slightly stale small muffins.When I brought up our concerns to the check-out person, we were told, 'It is an old building. When I asked for some compensation, the clerk shrugged her shoulders. I asked for a manager. The tall female (seemingly barely out of high school) gave us the same response. I cautioned that a negative comment was 10 times more powerful thatn a positive one, I was not given a response, comment card or name of an executive or owner.I would highly recommend all potential visitors to search elsewhere. Luckily I chose not to pay the $15 parking fee.I travel a lot and have stayed in some medicre hotels but the INn @ Queen Anne was the worst in ambiance, features and customer relations.",1
711,711,"Location great and that's about it! If you plan on attending a function at the Key Arena, the location of this hotel is awesome. If you want a nice comfortable room then this is NOT the hotel for you. The rooms are super small, totally outdated and somewhat dirty. I felt like I was in an old run down apartment building that was converted to a hotel room. Our room (208) had trim coming off the wall ( and would have been dangerous for children) the pipe that runs through the bathroom gets really hot and can burn you and the furnace is older then dirt. The bathroom was awful and if you are super tall or any bit overweight you seriously would have a hard time fitting in there. The light over the bed is so close to the bed that you can hit your head easily and the bed is the smallest queen size bed I have ever slept in. To make matters worse we asked for a wake up call and it never came, meaning we almost missed our ride to the airport. When I asked why the call never came all the girl at the front desk could say was oops, sorry about that, I just got here.We seriously stayed out as long as possible so we didn't have to go back to the room, it's quite depressing. We asked if they had bigger rooms and they said all the rooms were the same size. Don't recommend this hotel for families and especially children. If your just staying a night to attend the arena then it's doable but I won't be back there!!!",1
712,712,"I will return here, if ever going to Seattle again Booked this hotel without knowing more than it was a budget hotel. At check-in, my friends and I, were met by a friendly, warm, welcome. The rooms, as you might have read in other reviews, are simple but charming. Beds-OK, bathroom-OK, really big closet, and a nice little kitchenette.The breakfast could not be described as a great experience, but who needs that when you have your own little kitchenette? Bring coffee from the lobby and prepare your own bacon and eggs, that can be bought from a supermarket located not more than 150 metres away.What made the stay a great experience was the friendly staff (especially Dana), conveniant compementary shuttle service, low price, and the great location. A 10-15 minute walk you are in the city center, 2 minutes to Key Arena, (20 minutes to Hooters restaurant), 20 minutes to Pike Market, 8 minutes to Space Needle.///Anders with friends",4
713,713,"Not Bad At All Old, but mostly nice hotel. Room was fine, except for the bathroom, which while clean, could use some updating. Front desk was very nice, housekeeping did a fine job. Nice big windows overlooking the Queen Anne neighborhood. Parking 1/2 block from the hotel was $15 per night.Didnt try the breakfast. Did not hear the other guests, so soundproofing is good.Location really is fantastic, almost right across the street from Key Arena, Space Needle and Monorail to downtown just a bit further. Plenty of restaurants/bars within walking distance as well as Metropolitan Market.This really is a unique place to stay. If you can overlook some flaws with the bathroom, the Inn At Queen Anne is a nice, inexpensive place to stay in a fabulous location. The wife and I will certainly return.",4
714,714,"Comfortable, good location, but nothing to write home about... With only a week to book a hotel room, we found this to be a decent, affordable option when all the BBs were full. The Inn is a converted apartment building. The rooms are a bit shabby, but not terrible. I prefer shabby historic charm over a generic hotel any day. Rooms with A/C are more expensive, I believe. Parking is an additional fee. There are muffins and coffee provided in the lobby in the mornings.",3
715,715,"A Great, Quirky Little Hotel Yes, it's not the Hilton or the even the Best Western, but for the price, the Queen Anne is GREAT! My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Do not expect anything fancy--think quirky with character. Bathroom was tiny but clean, kitchenette was straight out of the 70's, but also clean. Also had a very surprising walk-in closet! The location is the best part--right near Seattle Center and Metropolitan Market. Just head over to the market for a REAL breakfast and any other needs you may have.Our room was air-conditioned. The fan worked fine. The furniture was serviceable.The free shuttle service was great, the driver was helpful, and the front desk staff was always friendly. Honesty, we will return here. If you want fancy, go elsewhere.",4
716,716,"Delightful find! This charming hotel is in an excellent, safe location within walking distance of interesting restaurants, theaters, the Space Needle, the Experience Music Project, the Pacific Science Center, and public transportation to both downtown and the U District. The staff was friendly and helpful. A bonus is the complementary shuttle service to downtown. Our room was clean and comfortable, containing a kitchenette. Although the hotel was full, we did not hear any other guests, indicating good soundproofing in the walls. My only complaint is that the ceiling fan and window air conditioner are noisy, but they don't need to be turned on. In addition, we could hear water running continually through the pipes, slightly distracting us during the night. However, these minor annoyances do not detract from the remarkable value of this hotel.",4
717,717,"Stay Away Do your best and stay away from here. We saw the website and fell into the trap. The website looks pretty nice, and for the Seattle area the price wasn't too bad. Unfortunately, it's a trap. First off, they don't guarantee any parking. This is pretty crappy, because it is the downtown Seattle area, so parking can be hard to come by. They have a garage that is a few blocks away, so if you're lucky (or unlucky) you'll park here. We did. I didn't enjoy it. It is underneath a grocery store and there are a million pigeons in it (they make a serious mess, and I think you get the picture). The doors to the garage are locked at around 10P. So if you want/need to leave at night, I think you're out of luck. The front desk staff was quite rude to us. They really didn't care about any problems that were reported to them, and they were more concerned with chatting with each other, rather than the guests. The room we were stuck with was terrible. Yes, it had a view of the Space Needle, but that doesn't make up for the problems. The ceiling was a complete mess. It was quite obvious that they have/had serious water damage. The doors (hallway door and bathroom door) did not shut very well at all. The bathroom was the worst problem. The ceiling was twice as bad as the main room. The mirror/medicine cabinet that was hanging on the wall was barely attached. It had a small shelf below it and it was falling off the wall. All of the tiles around the fixtures in the shower/tub were falling off the wall. Literally. The only thing that was holding them in place was the fact that they were attached to each other and their weight held them up there. The paint in the bathroom looked like it hadn't been painted since the building was built (and that wasn't recently). The black mold all over everything was a real nice touch also. You have to ignore a problem like this for a long time to get fur that long. The rooms all come with a small switch/hub for internet. Unfortunately you have to bring your own CAT5/e cable, that means no WiFi. The TV was big. The breakfast was terrible. There were a couple small over ripe pieces of fruit and some sort of bread product. I've stayed a lot of places that offered bad continental breakfasts, and this was the lowest on the scale.",1
718,718,"Glorified Hostel After reading the divergent reviews of the Inn at Queen Anne, I decided to take a chance and make a two-day reservation for my nephew and myself as part of a one-week trip to Seattle and Oregon. I have been to Seattle many times on business and/or personal trips as I love the city and it's many offerings. The Queen Anne neighborhood is adjacent to the Seattle Center about a dozen blocks North of the Central Business District in an eclectic neighborhood. This is about the only good thing I can say about the property. Seattle is experiencing record heat and only half the rooms have air conditioning. Not only did we not have an air conditioned room but the celiing fan must have been over 10 years and worked about as well. Furniture was sparse as were the beds. The kitchenette was a 15 year old eyesore with possibly the first microwave ever made with a dial timer. The bathroom was small but clean and furnished with nice amenities such as unique soaps and lotions. However, the showerhead was literally installed at five feet (chest level for any normal size person). Breakfast consisted of juice, coffee, muffins and pastry with no fruit or cererals. After one steamy night even with all the windows open, my nephew wanted to go to an air-conditioned with wi-fi internet to finish a summer college course he was taking. My nephew who is a US Marine just returned from a seven month tour of duty in Iraq's Al Anbar Province said he would have rather stayed in his Ramadi barracks (which were air conditioned) than this hotel. As a world traveler, I agreed and we checked out.",1
719,719,"Gem near the Space Needle I was a little leery about staying here after I had read a number of unfavorable reviews. If you can overlook the utilitaian furniture and the peeling ceiling paint job, this little hotel is in a great location. It is across the street from the Seattle Center, loads of restaurants within walking distance, a great 24 houir gourmet super market and a 24 hour drug store. It is right on the bus line, but the hotel also offers a shuttle to service (free) to many of the local attrations within a three mile radius and a town car service to meet you at the airport which is especially helpful if you arrive late at night. The hotel which is a converted 1930's apatment building , also has a refrigerator, microwave, stove and kitchen utensils.We also found the hotel staff very helpful when our luggage did not arrive until the day after we did. The continental breakfast in the lobby is adequate as is the fresh fruit and coffee available all day.The only real down side of this hotel is there is no elevator. It is not the Ritz, nor did I expect it to be. It was a great value for the location.I would stay there again.",4
720,720,Loved the Inn at Queen Anne!       kitchen area,4
721,721,"Well, you get what you pay for..... Although old, the hotel is charming....at first. the rooms were fine. a full bed, kitchenette, bathroom, and walk in closet in a small area. our major issue with the hotel was that the bathroom was not working properly and staff was unhelpful. when we first arrived i could hear the toilet running. when i went to use the bathroom and flush it would not flush at all. luckily my husband was able to fix it for the moment or else i would have been very embarrassed having hotel staff do it. also, i kept hearing the sound of a fire alarm that had low battery.....that 'cheep' every 60 seconds!!!! i could hear it with the doors closed and the tv on. i called to complain about it as it was difficult to sleep. all it needed was another battery. i am unsure if they did anything about it that night or not. the next morning when taking a shower we discovered that the bathtub was clogged and when taking a shower water poured out of both the shower spout and the bath spout. the bath spout water was scalding hot so you had to try to stand in such a way so that the water didn't burn your feet as it puddled up due to the clog. also, the shower head is situated at shoulder level (but that was the least of our problems!). again, we were still having toilet problems. we complained when we left the hotel for the day about the bathroom issues. we left at 10am. when we returned at 5pm there had been no change. we had to complain AGAIN and this time they sent the maintanence man to work on the toilet and finally change the smoke detector battery!!!! so that was fun sitting on our bed while the man worked on the toilet! anyway, i guess there were several problems with the toilet b/c once he fixed the problem and left, the toilet was then just running non stop. we complained AGAIN and they offered to change our room. they gave us keys to a room 2 doors down and when we walked in we could hear water running! the bathtub spout was leaking....not just dripping but running and no matter how tightly you turned the dials the water was just pouring out. we decided to stay at our room b/c at least we could turn the water off for the toilet! uggh! the staff just laughed when we told them that. they were not bothered or embarrassed or anything. that's what really got me. the fact that the staff does not keep up the place or try to fix things that are an easy fix is really sad. this would otherwise be a decent place to stay.some things to be aware of:1. i would not recommend staying here in the summer as it does not have a/c...maybe some rooms do but ours did not. there is a ceiling fan but ours was so noisy it was better not to use it. also, opening windows isn't really an option b/c there are no screens so unless you want a bird or bugs flying in, i wouldn't recommend that.2. there are no elevators so if you are handicapped that might be a problem. one lady we met there walked with a cane. she was upset that no one offered to help her. apparently she had to park far away and bring her luggage to the hotel and no one was able/willing to assist her. we did not have a car so i cannot speak to the car parking issues.i'll end on the positives1. the area is cool. alot of restaurants. some recommendations: Tini Bigs (awesome martinis!!!!), Rice and Spice (excellent Thai- try the pumpkin curry!!!), Chutneys (great Indian- i'd recommend the marsala! i would not recommend the seafood tandoori- the salmon had bones in it).  2. very close to the space needle!3. having the free shuttle is a nice touch and was always available when we needed it (although it is only available until 5pm).all in all, i'd spend a little extra to have a functional toilet/smoke detector/some a/c!",2
722,722,"Cute, clean, friendly, amazing price We blocked rooms at this hotel for our out-of-town guests at our October 2006 wedding in Seattle. The price was unbeatable, and the hotel has a certain charm with its garden entranceway. Definitely a step above a Holiday Inn or the other generic cheapy hotels. The rooms are really simple, but very clean, with tiny kitchenettes (in some cases a 2 burner stove and a toaster). The staff is incredibly friendly. Also, the location is fantastic, Queen Anne is charming and cool, with easy access to Seattle Center and Downtown. I just can't get over the quality of this hotel for the price (our guest paid $79/night). One friend called it dormlike but my dorm room was not this clean or cute. Our guests on a budget all had a good experience there. I believe they do free coffee in the lobby and free wine some evenings. All in all it was a fantastic option for budget-concious wedding guests. We also blocked rooms at the fancier but still affordable Marqueen, the sister hotel to this one which is right up the block. I highly recommend this hotel for super affordable, clean, cute, basic lodging.",4
723,723,"terrible hotel Approximately 2 weeks ago (April 25, 2007), I made a reservation with this hotel for one night, May 19, 2007). I wrote to them with a follow-up request, and in their reply, they advised me my reservation had been cancelled, due to overbooking.I wote to them again, giving my reservation number, but they just wrote back again, just saying sorry, and making no effort to find me a room in another, nearby hotel. I had rhe emails from Brigeta, Operation Manager. And if I would not have written to them approximately 2 weeks before my stay, I am positive I would have been left to scrambe for a new hotel from the lobby of the Inn at Queen Anne.I find this practice unforgivable, especially in light of having a resevation number guarenteeing my room on May 19, 2007. What is the point of making advance reservations at this hotel if they suddenly cancel it, with little advance notice to me?Sincerely,Greg ScanlonSan Francisco",1
724,724,"Great price, okay experience I stayed at the Inn at Queen Anne for three nights in mid-January of 2007. The price was very good -- $79/night -- and the room was fine. It was old and shabby, but clean and comfortable. Having a kitchenette with microwave, stove, sink and fridge was great, and the room had a surprisingly large walk-in closet. The service was friendly, but no one warned me that the desk staff leaves at 11:00 pm. Calls to the front desk after that hour are fielded by staff at another hotel, which can be problem -- for example, I needed to request an iron and ironing board for the next morning and wasn't able to get one because the guy at the other hotel couldn't get anyone at the Queen Anne to answer the phone. Also, the Inn at Queen Anne has no elevator, which wasn't a problem for me but could be a big problem for some.The other downside was the noise. This hotel seems to have no soundproofing at all between the rooms; on my first night I had to get out of bed at 2:30 AM and go ask my next-door neighbors (who had some kind of party going on) to please hold it down. And in the morning, the plumbing noise is deafening -- every morning I was awakened at about 6:00 pm by the showers in the rooms around me.However, the location is great; this hotel is just north of the Space Needle, and smack in the middle of what seems to be Seattle's bohemian-hip neighborhood. There's an excellent CD shop just around the corner, as well as several restaurants and a Safeway. So if you're a deep sleeper and don't need first-class accomodations, this hotel is a good bargain.",3
725,725,Great no frills value We stay here every year when we come to Seattle for an event at the Seattle Center. The rooms are small but clean and everything you need is there. It's right across the street from the event center and a grocery store. Great value.,4
726,726,"Good Value -- Great Location We stayed for four nights in early November 2006 and were very satisfied.This hotel offers comfortable and affordable accomodations in an older but well maintained building. The staff was friendly, helpful and attentive. Don't expect luxury. This hotel offers great value given the accomodations and location. Highlights:Our deluxe room was clean and comfortable with a small walk-in closet, small efficeincy kitchen including basic utensils, dishes, glasses, pot and pan, etc. Shuttle service.Cofee, tea and juice service available in lobby 24/7Free high-speed internet and cable serviceAcross the street from the Space Needle, Key Arena (Supersonics), Seattle Center (Experience Music Project, Sci-Fi Museum, IMAX, Theatre (plays), etc.Public buses stop right in front of hotel.Two food stores and a drug store within one block of hotel.Excellent restaurants and shops on and around block (Thai, Indian, Continental, Record store, dry cleaners, etc.)The building resembles an older but well maintained smaller apartment building. The rooms facing the street can be noisey at night due to car traffic. If possible, ask for a room in the back of the building. Overall we highly recommend this hotel for the budget minded traveler that's not a light sleeper.",4
727,727,"Poor Organisation My wife and I booked one night in this hotel in September 2006. I booked the room by corresponding directly with the hotel via email. I booked the room in April 2006 and confirmed it before we left Australia in early September 2006.You would think that, having booked it so far in advance, there would be no problems.Needless to say, I was surprised to find out when we arrived that they had overbooked and we did not have a room. To their credit, they had booked us into their sister hotel around the corner, the MarQueen Hotel which, were were told, was a higher class hotel.It appeared though, after further questioning, that the MarQueen Hotel did not provide breakfast whereas it had been included in our initial booking. After waiting a short time to see the manager, we obtained approval to walk back to the Inn at Queen Anne the next morning and have breakfast there.We did that the next morning. Unfortunately, the breakfast was pretty hopeless. It was set up in the foyer near the front counter. It was VERY basic with tea/coffee and pastries. There was little variety.See my further entry re the MarQueen Hotel/",2
728,728,"ideal for budget-minded Stayed here for 2 nights. THE GOOD: received the mid-week special price of $69/night for a deluxe queen room. Spotlessly clean. It was en suite, nice deep tub, shower, pretty soaps, shampoo and lotions. A walk in closet, 19 color cable TV, phone w/ free local calls, kitchenette with dishes, pans and silverware, a 2-burner gas stove, microwave, and fridge. You can buy fresh seafood, veggies and flowers at the market and take it home for dinner! Table and 2 dining chairs plus a lounge chair. Everything worked. Comfortable queen bed, decent linens. There were 3 large windows that open and a small A/C, plus a ceiling fan. There is a small garden, part of which is covered, nice spot for coffee. There is a small continental breakfast included, beginning at 7:30 AM. Also complimentary wine a couple evenings a week. The room I stayed in on the 3rd floor had a great view of the Space Needle. The building (actually 2 identical buildings connected by a covered walkway) I found charming, glass doorknobs, old fashioned hardware, Tiffany style lights in hallway. The furnishings were more modern, somewhat worn but comfortable, matching colors. All the staff that I spoke to were friendly and helpful. This place is literally 3 blocks from Key Arena which is next to the Seattle Center. It is about a 30 minute walk to Pike Place Market or buses #15  #18 will take you for $1.25; there is a bus stop across the street and one around the block. There is a Safeway and QVC stores each within 1 block. There is a liquor store practically next door, and a movie theater around the block. Several eateries are steps away. The neighborhood seemed safe to walk about in the evening, plenty of people around and well lighted.THE SO-SO (can't really say anything bad): Parking was an additional $11/day and was across the street and behind the post office. Others have mentioned the option of paying for curbside parking every 2 hours during the day, free at night. The fridge was cold enough to keep milk fresh for a couple days, but not cold enough to freeze ice. The bath towels were on the small side. There was some street noise fairly late I think, but not enough to keep me awake; I imagine the other building would be quieter.",4
729,729,"Nice For The Price If You're Low Maintenance This is a nice place in the Queen Anne/Belltown neighborhood of Seattle. It's an old apartment building or rooming house. The rooms are pretty plain and a little on the small side (for American tastes), but they are nice. The property is quaint (in the good way), and is walking distance to the Space Needle and Monorail, and it has good connections to the city's bus lines to take you to the tourist sites (Pike Place, Pioneer Square, waterfront). The rooms have kitchens, and there are two grocery stores within a block if you want to cook. The front desk staff is nice, but not always the most helpful. This is a great place for anyone who is looking simply for a place to sleep while you're doing a lot outside the hotel. The morning breakfast is nothing to speak of, but there are plenty of good coffee options in a block's radius. If you're picky, be sure to request a room with AC, as not all of them come equipped (it's not always needed in Seattle). Some friends staying here complained of stiff pillows or mattresses, but mine (room 307) was fine.",4
730,730,"Good location Our initial impressions from the outside were good but less impressive once inside. The hotel is showing signs of age and would benefit from upgrading - perhaps starting with new carpets. Our room was small and our daughter had a fold out bed but we had some warning of this when booking and we did book at short notice. The outdoor garden, prominent in photos of the hotel, could also be improved by some investment - better paving and more seating for starters. Good points were the continental breakfast and the free shuttle. The location is also good - a short monorail journey from downtown Seattle.",3

732,732,"A little too quaint After a 2 night stay I have to state that, while the Inn definitely had an old-time feeling and ambiance, it had too much of that feeling for us.The biggest plus is that the Inn is only 2 blocks from the Seattle Center. The downside is that if you are looking for a typical motel/ hotel environment, this Inn is not for you.A very aged room with steam radiators and a noisy a/c is is sometimes OK, but when I had to go one block to a store to get ice (no ice on the property!), then that was too much.Some folks will love the quirks, but we didn't.The price is certainly agreeable, but we will check out other nearby hotels next time.",2
733,733,"a decent hotel I was apprehensive about staying at the Inn after reading a lot of bad reviews, but had a good stay regardless. I loved the fact that it was close to the Seattle center and great restaurants (mecca cafe, pagiacci pizza). The room was well kept, with a proper kitchenette which was always clean. Had to request extra pillows, but the staff couldn't have been nicer about it. There was also a free continental breakfast with muffins and bread, but I couldn't get up before ten.If you are a light sleeper I'd advise bringing ear plugs, since the exterior noise can be a but much sometimes. Also getting back to the hotel from the downtown area can be a bit confusing, since the monorail isn't working, so picking up a bus map would probably be a good idea as well, if you decide to go exploring. Otherwise everything was great.",3
734,734,"old and dumpy But this place had so many problems that my head starts spinning when thinking where to start. We got there at like 10pm for check-in and was told we'd have to park on the street cuz no parking left on their lot. The room was tiny and the carpet was dirty in some spots. The room came with a kitchen, but it was nasty and so we never used it. Especially the fridge... the first and only time we opened it, the nasty odor of rotten vegetables gushed out of the fridge and filled the entire room. Throughout day and night, we could hear people talking and walking up and down the stairwell right outside. Also the noise from the streets right outside the window was substantial. There's just no sound insulation at all at this place. Bathroom was surprisingly clean, the only part of our room that appeared well-kept. But the shower pressure was horrible throughout our stay, and we ran out of hot water twice. In fact, one morning I took a cold shower basically from start to end. The front desk staff was generally nice. But there was this one guy who was completely uncaring and unhelpful... not sure what his problem was. The only thing I liked about this place was that it had a ceiling fan and a walk-in closet. We paid $100/night for this place, which I suppose is reasonable for the Seattle Center area. But I'd pay $40 more a night to stay at Holiday Inn Express or something. I basically can't recommend this place to anyone.",1
735,735,"We Loved the Inn at Queen Anne The Inn at Queen Anne is a great place to stay. Where else can you get a nice room with a kitchenette and walk in closet for under $125. a night? All the staff was top notch - from the maintenance men working outside the building to the desk clerks to the shuttle drivers. They were all very friendly and helpful. We would recommend this hotel to anyone and if we visit Seattle again, we will definitely stay at the Inn at Queen Anne. Thanks!",5

737,737,"great location and staff The location and price make this Older Hotel a good choice. The staff are very friendly. If you are looking for a modern place this is not for you. This is an old studio apartment building that is now run as a hotel. In a great neighborhood close to great local resturants. The hotel does not have a sterile tourist feeling that most of the newer mid range hotels have. It feels more like a small European Hotel. Yes, the rooms could use a little moderizing, but one must compermise. We just made reservations for another stay",3
738,738,"Two Thumbs Down What a disappointment. This might be fine for the leisure traveler but it's not recommended for the business traveler. 1. Parking is hit-or-miss. You have to pull up at the curb, go in, and see if they have parking available. If not, you may park on the street at a meter overnight or in a pay lot within a few blocks of the hotel. 2. There is no elevator and no mention of this on their website or when you call to make a reservation. 3. Only special rooms have Internet access (this is Seattle!) Again, this is not mentioned anywhere on their website or when I *specifically* asked for the difference in room types. 4. Rooms are small but servicable. Nothing to write home about. No irons/boards in the room. No coffee service. 5. No one available to check me out at 6:30am. I left early to try to get to an Internet cafe the desk clerk told me opened at 6am. Uh, it opened at 7:00 and I had to be on my way across town at a meeting by then. If I were a leisure traveler, none of this would have bothered me quite so much but as a business traveler, no thanks. You definitely get what you pay for. I doubt I'll be back.",1
739,739,"I will return again I stayed at the Inn at Queen Anne just last week, and it was my third visit to this hotel. It is not a fancy place, and those who are used to the Westin should save their time and energy and stay elsewhere. However, for myself and the 3 other people I was with, we found this place to be perfect for our needs. I like that all rooms have celing fans and that you can actually open the windows! The bed was comfortable, but extra pillows are a must, and earplugs are helpful if you are a light sleeper. We had tons of extra hot water, at about 11 AM. The room size seemed totally reasonable to us, we have stayed in smaller rooms for less money. The staff was excellent, and even mailed me a pair of sunglasses I had left behind in the room (Thanks Brigita!). The location is excellent- Queen Anne is a great place (and we are well-traveled in the Seattle area) good food, fantastic indie record store and Key Arena all within 1-2 blocks. We usually stay in downtown Seattle (in 2 to 4 star hotels), but have recently chosen this area instead, as it has more of a neighborhood feel. Bottom line, if you are high maintenance, expect everything to be perfect, and have an issue with things not being brand new, then go elsewhere. But if you are looking for a comfortable, VERY reasonably priced hotel that offers good service and has more character than most places, then choose the Inn at Queen Anne.",4
740,740,"What a value! We loved the Inn at Queen Anne. My husband and I came to town to see Bon Jovi and we searched on line for hotels near the Key Arena. We were a little apprehensive due to the negative reviews, but found ourselves a hotel that we will return to again and again. You can't find a deal like this anywhere in Seattle. This hotel is not the Westin but it has a lot of charm and is in a perfect location.",4
741,741,"An incredible dump! You get what you pay for! Although this place looks charming on the website, RUN don't walk from this dump. As we walked down the musty, dirty hallway, we saw two patrons with their doors open in their underway smoking and cooking their smelly dinner. The room is small, shabby,dirty and cold. Amenities? None here. The location and neighborhood are great as is the price. However, unless you want a Flophouse or run down YMCA, look elsewhere. I swear this place is a half way house!We checked out the next morning and headed for the Westin. This place is scary!! I would not even give this place one star!",1
742,742,"Great place in Queen Ann While I can see the point of the negative reviews I still love this place for the money. If you are interested in more upscale try their other property the MarQueen which is 2 blocks north.Pros: Great PriceFriendly atmosphereCleanGreat lively neighborhood (make sure you try the food at Peso's) that has more of a neighborhood feel than downtown.Free Shuttle (when it's not busy)Cons:Far from downtown (I like this neighborhood better than downtown, lots with-in walking distance, when you want to head downtown the monorail is a quick 10min walk or take the hotel's free shuttle).Unattractive Exterior.No ElevatorAll and all this is my favorite hotel in Seattle for the price, hands down.",4
743,743,"Old-style character at Inn at Queen Anne? You're joking! Hi, folks! Let me make it clear straight away that I never give bad reviews to any place, person or thing, but when I booked to stay at this place, I was expecting true Olde Worlde charm, courtesy and service, as that is how they advertise themselves. But what did I get? I arrived at the hotel after an 11 hour flight plus another 45 minutes from Seatac airport to get here, and they kept me waiting for what seemed like an eternity! Eventually, they found my internet reservation and marched me off to my room on the 3rd floor (no lift) and no help whatsoever. Anyway, the room was so small, you couldn't swing a mouse in it, let alone a cat! The A/C unit did not work and the whole room was just so claustrophobic, I just couln't get oout of there fast enough! In the morning, the fun and games started--I got into the bathroom for a shower, and guess what--no hot water! And the bath tub and taps--they must have bought them in some garage sale during the 1940s--they were so rusty and horrible--yuck! Anyway, downstairs for a bit of coffee and their continental breakfast--this turned out to be cheao supermarket bagels and commercial coffee made in an ancient percolater! My advice--DO NOT STAY THERE--at least until they kick out all their Staff and bring new guys in with some courtesy and revamp the whole building!",1
744,744,"Location and accomodation at QA The previous reviewer was very complete.Let me preface my review by saying I got a package on the Internet. Then I read the less than favorable reviews so I was rather apprehensive on arrival.Inn at Queen Anne are former studio apts in building built in the 1920's or 30's. Actually, while on the bus, I met a woman who volunteered she lived there in the 1960's also said she was one of the first TWA stewardess. In her 70's??? she was still a beauty.Back to QA, it is an older apt and not the Hilton, but I liked it, its location, and the staff was completely accomodating not ever mentioning my Internet status. Actually, I don't think the price was that different from what everyone else was paying. I won't repeat the description of the previous reviewer all of which is true. BUT, I will emphasize the convenience of the grocery store across the store and the bus stop at the corner.Also, emphasize the free shuttle to downtown supplied by Queen Anne. I had no water pressure problems as described, but in a hotel I normally shower in the evening since I believe most people shower in the morning which can cause a problem in older hotels. Water simply gushed out of the shower like it does in older showers that don't have water control. (My room was on the 2nd floor.) Sometimes older is better.:)To the airport. I arrived at 10:30 pm so I took a cab because I didn't want to be transferring at all hours of the night. But on return to airport, I took free shuttle (provided by QA) to the Westin where I got a bus for $10.25 to the airport. Since the Westin is the next-to-last on the route, there wasn't much time spent driving around to other hotels. Then, it was less than 1/2 hour to airport. BTW, the Westin has a fantastic concierge service. Since my convention was there, I got their service as well as help at QA. Also, the Westin openly advertises the bus to airport leaving every hour at 21 and 51 minutes after the hour.",4
745,745,"Great Little Place.. Excellent Location! First off if you are expecting the Hilton - the Queen Anne is not that. If the Hilton is what you are expecting find a Hilton and pay the price otherwise do not complain about this nice little quaint hotel!Pros: Very Comfy - everything worked in the room. Rooms were small, but I like to think of it as cozy instead of small. The closets are real large so therefore much of your traveling items can be stored out of arms way. I believe all the units have a small kitchenette which consists of a (2) burner stove, microwave, sink, cupboards, small fridg and enough dishes and silverware to accomedate 2 just fine. The staff was very friendly and helpful. There is a continental breakfast offered with coffee, OJ, and rolls - there may be more I was not sure as my husband just went down one morning to get me some OJ and a roll. I can say the roll and OJ was tasty and fresh.The maid server was very nice and did a good job on cleaning daily.There is high speed internet available in the rooms, which is a plus if you are like me and have a traveling office which requires you to work while out of town.Location is absolutely wonderful. Walking distance to space needle and Key arena activities, many restaurants close by and the metro bus lines are right there to take you where ever you little heart desires at a very reasonable small fee. PLUS a grocery store right across the street, drug store about 1 block away some smaller businesses like office supplies etc! How wonderful is this. The staff pointed out that is is about the same price to take a Towncar from the Sea-Tac then a taxi. And they have one that they recommend. I mean why not we did ~ hmmm Taxi or Towncar.. not really to hard of a decision there for the same price. I am sure the shuttle may of been a few dollars cheaper, so if you don't mind a 1 1/2 hour shuttle ride to save nothing more then a couple bucks then take the shuttle, otherwise the towncar is the way to go between airport and the Inn At Queen Anne.Cons: The pillows could be a little fluffier. We solved that by asking for a couple more pillows which the staff supplied without hesitation. There is not that much hot water or pressure. We stayed there for 6 nights and found that if at all possible take your shower around noon or a little after. There is really no need to turn on the cold water knob when taking a shower and the shower head can be rotated to help with the pressure aspect. Other then them two small issues really just one the water pressure (the pillows can be solved by asking for more pillows) - I cannot say anything negative about the Inn At Queen AnneAgain this is not the Hilton or even the Radisson it is a small 1930's quaint Inn located in a nice area and for the age still holds her head fairly high. It shows and feels charactor. You can almost feel the history within the walls. And the price cannot be beat!We will stay there again if we have a need to go to Seattle again!",5

748,748,"Low Priority to Internet Customers We too would advise you to stay somewhere else if you want to have a nice weekend in Seattle. I called to confirm my reservation a few days before arriving and was told that inertnet customers get last priority. Nice. I should have cancelled right then, but didn't. Big mistake. True to their word they gave us a room on the 3rd floor (no elevator in the building) which was one step up from a flop house. The air conditioner blew warm air and the windows didn't open. Thankfully there was no fire or we would be dead. Maintenance came up to check the A/C and said oh yes we have a part on order but it's not in, so they knowingly gave us a room that would be a greenhouse. Ok so we went out during the evening and came back to try to sleep in the hothouse got about 4 hours of fitfull sleep due to the heat, traffic noise and lights from across the street. Woke up next day to shower and guess what no hot water, the knob was actually broken, something they no doubt knew before they gave their sucker internet customers this room. Fortunately they moved us to another room that day and we noticed another poor no doubt low priority internet customer moving into the room a few hours later. Run don't walk to another hotel. This was a really bad experience for us.",1
749,749,"What a dump..... We stayed last weekend and had expected a Charming 1929 property based on the web-site and the reviews on Expedia. We didn't expect Charming to mean incompetent staff, showers that randomly go from scalding to cold and from medium pressure to just a trickle, tacky acoustic ceilings, moldy non-functional windows in the shower, no screens on the windows or no A/C, having our room left unlocked after maid service, having to wait 18 hours for an iron which gave us 30 minutes to make it to a wedding, having to move the car at 8am because the parking was thought to be full by the front desk when in reality it wasn't, etc., etc.Expedia apparantly won't publish negative reviews like this I gather after having tried 3 times to publish it on-line, calling customer service and exchanging several e-mails with them. Beware of what reviews you see on Expedia and especially beware of hotels like this one.",1
750,750,"absolutely charming and good value I have stayed in numerous hotels in Seattle from characterless two star chains to suites at the Westin and Olympic in the past 45 plus years. But the Inn at Queen Anne really stands out among the crowd. This has to be just about the best value accommodation in Seattle. I loved this place. It is an older converted brick apartment building that is loaded with charm. You enter through a pretty courtyard with trees, flowers, etc. The wonderful-smelling hallways have stained-glass light fixtures, wing-back chairs, and a sprinkling of antiques. The rooms are not large but are far from tiny and very comfortable and clean. ( I had a standard queen. Some slightly larger rooms have a queen and a twin. They also have junior suites and one bedroom suites ). The mission-style furnishings were more upscale than I had expected for a two star hotel. The bath was small but cute with its pedestal sink, gold mirror, and elegant light fixture. The soaps, etc. were also upscale, and the towels, while not huge or tremendously fluffy, were still more than adequate, and again, more than I had expected. Although I didn't use the little kitchen, it could certainly come in handy for a lot of people. The room also had a nice walk-in closet, which was a real surprise. The queen-sized bed was firm and comfortable and the carpets newer and clean. The staff was friendly and accommodating and the (free) continental breakfast fresh and good. Parking across the street was only $10 through the hotel, a bargain in Seattle.I know that some writers have complained about the hotel, but I don't understand why. This place is cute, charming, fun and a heck of a good deal. I am recommending it to my friends and even to my 87 year-old mother. If you like same-same and cookie-cutter, this may not be your place. But for charm, individuality, and even a slight touch of refinement, grace, and elegance, you too may fall in love with it, as did I.",5

Observed several items, ie irons, hair dryers, and extra pillows were often not available from the front desk but the staff we spoke to did seem to try to help but we were continually asked to check back later if they could not accommodate. The few members of the staff we spoke to were not very knowledgable but the hotel lobby has many brochures, pamphlets, and mags that guided us.

Oh, we do know to ask for a room on the courtyard (avoid rooms on the street side), and have enjoyed the same room several times (it has a pine tree out the window). The location is great for our purposes (attending the annual Northwest Folklife Festival across the street at Seattle Center, where we met in '98). We love the local restaurants, too, especially Racha Thai. The kitchenette comes in handy, and it's a block to great stores for food, etc.Last time we stayed there we received free high-speed internet access because they forgot to mention the extra charge for it.

In fact, the closet was almost bigger than the entire room.",1

At one point, we were told to go out and purchase our own iron, since the one's they had were all taken for the evening (we had asked ahead of time if we should have reserved it and they said no).

A little different experience than most nameless, faceless hotels - but that's what we prefer.Charming, homey place in a great neighborhood.",4
760,760,"Terrible experience I made a reservation here entirely based on a decent review from Frommer's. When I walked into the lobby, the desk clerk did not have the room I reserved, was very rude, and I actually walked out the door at 8pm without a backup plan. The place was that bad. The room I was shown was dank, cramped, and stank. Avoid this place. Trust me.",1
761,761,"I will never return to this 'hotel' again. It isn't that I was expecting a luxury hotel, because I was more interested in saving money. And that I did. In exchange for saving money, who knew I also would have to settle for bad service all around . The thing I will always remember ( and maybe it was just a coincidence). But, every time I had to walk to the front desk to ask for something I didn't get in my room, or to complain about my room not being serviced during my stay, the manager I needed to tell all of this to, was walking out the door and, 'done for the day'. How frustrating is that, when the office mgr. has put in her time at work, and no longer cares after she clocks out??? I never got the impression she cared anyway, but to actually show and display that, was a shock to me. Two big thumbs down on this place.",1
762,762,"Worst Birthday present ever For my birthday a friend and I decided to take a trip to Seattle and stay a few nights. This hotel seemed to be promising because they could give us a small kitchenette in order to save money on going out to eat. When we got there we found that they did not have any pots or pans to cook with which we promised over the phone. To make it worse they couldn't find one, or acquire one for us. So we had to then walk to the store and BUY one in order to cook the food that we had brought with us. To make matters worse our toilet was clogged, several of our lights didn't work, the water took about 30 minutes to heat up and the ceiling looked like it would collapse over night. At the end of our 3 day stay all the manager would do was take off our room tax, and sent us home with our newly bought pot (we recommended he keep the pot for the room and refund the money we paid for it). For as much as one would pay to stay at this vintage hotel, they might as well stay at motel 6 down the street.",1

777,777,"Captures the essence of Queen Anne If you want to come to Seattle and actually experience what it's like to live in town, this is the place to stay. The rooms are converted turn-of-the-century apartments, which are quite common in the city. Like many of those apartments, the hotel has updated and improved the rooms only where necessary, but keeping up the mainenance as best as possible, while retaining the historic charm. There is a catch; the plumbing is old, noisy, and unpredictable. I haven't had a shower like that since I moved out of my old North Tacoma home (c. 1923). So many different temperatures, such a short amount of time! Charming, sure, but definitely NOT enjoyable. I would recommend upgrading the plumbing to a modern recirculating hot water system. Also, the television in the room was old, not HD, and was clearly wearing out. Again, this is what living in Seattle, especially on Queen Anne, is ACTUALLY like.The flip side, of course, to the imprefections is the absolutely excellent location. This area of Queen Anne is one of the most convenient areas in Seattle to stay in. Restaurants, bars, shopping, entertainment are all very numerous and right around the corner in literally every direction. And although the view of the water and mountains from the front of the hotel is excellent, I recommend a short walk up the hill to Kerry Park for the best view in the city (get your own directions, I know you know how; maps.google.com). I will warn you, it's a very steep hike up Queen Anne Ave. But well worth it for the view.As a former resident in the neighborhood, I can tell you street parking in the area is difficult to say the least. For this reason, I utlized the hotel's valet parking extensively. You get in and out privelages, but I recommend calling ahead from your room to have your car brought up as it does take a few minutes, especially around check-in and check-out times.I found the staff (especially the doorman) to be VERY attentive. I took more advantage of their services than usual as I was staying at the hotel for my brother's wedding (held off-site), and I was thoroughly impressed. They met every reqeuest and didn't give anyone any grief over any of it.Another warning: rooms on the front of the hotel are subject to noise from bar across the street (and just general late-night street noise) that can last into the wee hours of the morning. if you are a light sleeper, ask for a room on the back. The catch with that is, you don't get the view. Personally, I'd rather have the view. The street noise really wasn't bad except for one guy who came out of the bar yelling up a storm at 2am. He was gone quickly and I was back asleep.Room rates are reasonable. They're not the cheapest you'll find in Seattle, but for what you get, they are reasonable. Other reviews complaining seem to be out of touch with what things cost in a city like Seattle. I've paid considerably more for rooms in downtown that were not as large and had half the character.",4
778,778,"Value Boutique Hotel In a city full of over-priced hotels, pretentious venues and expensive parking, my wife and I have struggled to find a reasonable place to stay for our occasional trips from Eastern Washington.This hotel was a nice surprise. It is an old and partially renovated apartment building (I say partially, because the vault of the rooms are basically untouched beyond paint, the floors need a good polish and kitchens are not updated) with pleasant and tasteful decor. Our room had a fairly new Queen Anne (?) style bedroom set and a nice small sitting area, but really could not escape the feeling of just being old.The advantages are clear: it is a good value if you can get a room in the lower $100's (the rack rates are not a great value), it is walking distance to a number of theaters, activities and neighborhood restaurants, the kitchen is a nice plus (so you can stay in a hotel and box your unfinished dinner), street parking is available in an area that is not so seedy that you don't get over the initial nerves and the rooms are pretty comfortable if you can get past the lack of updated trimmings.By the way, our doorman was unusually attentive. Maybe someone reads these reviews...;-)",4
779,779,"Great Potential, but... As many other travelers have noted, this is a beautiful old building (actually a former apartment building) on the fringe of downtown Seattle.The hotel is located at the foot of Queen Anne Hill, a lively commercial and nightspot area.The building itself has a lot of potential. It was built around the turn of the 20th century, and is loaded with Old World Charm, as they say. The owners have tried - rightly - to capitalize on this heritage, with historic photos on the wall, and Victorian-style potted palms and plants in oversized urns. There are lovely oriental carpets and the rooms are large- - they are really single apartments (size-wise they are between a one bedroom and a studio).So what's the problem? There are a few, actually. We noted that the management has TRIED to capitalize on the historic nature of the building, but they have come up a bit short.To wit: The aforementioned potted plants? Fake. The oriental carpets (and the rest of the carpeting, for that matter) were tired and dingy. Not filthy, but dowdy. The red carpet (a nice touch) on the marble steps at the main entrance was marred by two crushed cork-tipped cigarette butts on the night we arrived. These details belie a standard of cleanliness and care that is noticeably below par. The place aims to be your glamorous old aunt but actually comes off a bit dowdy. The old girl needs a good scrubbing and some TLC.Then there is the matter of service. We have stayed at the Marqueen three times, and the service has been uneven. Sometimes very good, but more often simply lackadaisical, and occasionally surly. (Open note to management: An establishment that employs a doorman should instruct that person to OPEN THE DOOR for people as they approach, and not merely watch as patrons struggle to do so on their own).One gets the impression that these problems -- irritating though they may be -- are not insurmountable. Nothing that a visit to the beauty parlor for the building, and a refresher course in boardinghouse manners for the staff couldn't cure.",2
780,780,"Loads of charm! My family and I stayed at the Marqueen in early September, and we were thrilled with the lovely charm and ambience of the hotel. It felt more like our own little apartment room rather than a plain hotel room. My wife especially loved the little 'sitting room' area.There was a nice little kitchenette in our room, but please be warned that there are little or no utensils in order to cook anything more than a very simple packet meal. We are used to self contained rooms in most hotels including mixing bowls, can openers, cork removers, olive oil and other basics, but you don't get any of that here.Nevertheless, there are a couple of great supermarkets only a block away which can supply these and lots of great ingredients to cook.The hotel is only a 5 minute walk from the Seattle Center and Space Needle. We stayed here for nearly 2 weeks, and had absolutely no noise problems from the surrounding bars or other rooms. We were on the second floor facing at the back of the hotel.Definitely a highly recommended property, and we would stay there again if ever in Seattle.",5
781,781,"Disapointed The pictures online tell a different story.. The Lobby area was nice, as were the staff. There is no ice in the rooms or in a self serve location. I had to call room service for ice, and after 20 miniutes I went down to the desk and got it myself. Very dissapointed in the room, old and dumpy! The plummbing is not much better. Their restaurant is across the street, if you want room service from there it's 20% service charge + 18% gratuity???? Oh! and to park your car, it's $20.00 per night. My room was right across the street from a bar/restaurant that was noisy all night.",1
782,782,"Good choice in Seattle As others have said, this is a little gem of a boutique hotel on the edge of the downtown. Its an old building and while nicely maintained and restored, some people might not like the slightly old finish. We loved it. Our room was on the third floor at the back of the building. It meant that it was very quiet and we even had a fairly clear view of the Space Needle, which is only 5 blocks away. Our room had 2 queen size beds, a separate small sitting room and even a full kitchen. Everything worked and was very clean.The staff were very friendly and professional. Valet parking was quick and easy. Its location is in a partial residential area, so it has a homely feel outside, with lots of good neighbourhood restaurants and pubs. A short walk to the Seattle Center provided access to the monorail for a quck trip into the downtown.We will definitely stay here again when next in Seattle.",4
783,783,"Very nice and interesting stay 3 stories, no elevator. nice room that was a converted apartment. small kitchen area, nice view of the space needle. Close to city center. Was able to get on the monorail in city center and take it to downtown. Nice friendly staff.",4
784,784,"nice comfortable stay When people ask if we will stay at this hotel again, I would say yes. Just be more careful which room to be in.I stayed at MarQueen for 4 nights for business trip. Although some of the review was mentioning about noise, we thought having a spacious comfortable room was important. When we arrived, there were one couple before us, and they were asked if they prefer quiet room. They took the quiet room on 3rd floor. When we were checking in, the front desk person did not ask our preference... I just let it go, and took the room she gave us. Which turned out to be the direct across the noisy bar on 2nd floor room 204. It wasn't very noisy when we checked in around 4 pm. It was Wed. The noise from the bar started around 9 pm and ended around 2:30 am. Even though the window was shut, it could still hear the screaming guys and gals smoking outside the bar. I believe the hotel knew the noise problem from the bar, because there were set of ear plugs in the snack basket for the guest. We had to use ear plugs for the night. It was still weekday, I could not imagine how noisy the weekend will be!!! Next morning we changed to quiet room on 3rd floor facing backside of the building. Rest of the stay was wonderful. It is a funny thing... although we had loud noise problem, I still think staying at this hotel gave us sense of living in seattle. And we loved it. Maybe because the hotel is kind like an apartment, you feel like living there. Having a kitchen and dining area was very nice. It was very nice to have separate living area with sofa and coffee table.One more thing... if you have a car, parking around the hotel will be tough! There are a lot of restriction for street parking. You should expect to pay $20 per day for valet parking at hotel. You will be able to take car in and out through out the day. but you also pay tip to valet parker.When I went to downtown to meet my husband, I walked to monorail just about 10 min nice walk from the hotel. Once you take monorail, it only takes 2 min to get to Westlake Shopping Center which is the center of downtown.  If you decided to stay at MarQueen, avoid room on 2nd floor facing the street. If you want to have quiet room, ask for 3rd floor facing the back side of the building. You will have a little bit of the space needle in view from the window. I noticed that 2nd floor facing back has no view at all. They are looking at wall of next building which is very sad...",4
785,785,"Marqueen, the good and the bad This hotel is lovely and in a great location. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The desk and service personnel are knowledgeable and helpful without fail EXCEPT in one very important area:The only problem, and it was a major one for me, was that they refused to take our party of eight (we booked four rooms) to the Pier to meet our cruise. One of the main reasons we booked with this hotel was because of the transportation to the Pier. We were told that we could not monopolize the transportation (?) but no explanation was given as to why four couples could not be provided transportation. Evidently if we'd been four separate couples taking the same cruise but not acquainted they would have had no problem. We managed to find transportation at a very significant cost. The day we left, after moving our bags to the lobby and after our transportation arrived I inquired again as to their policy....and was told I had been given incorrect information and they would have taken us. Strange...as they refused to schedule us but then said they would have taken us if we were scheduled.Overall this is a good place to stay, but beware of transportation promises, it may not be there when you need it.",2
786,786,"Great location, staff and room We stayed at the hotel over the weekend and were very impressed by the staff and very happy with the property and the room. It's nice to stay in a hotel with some character and not the same box feel. The room was in excellent condition and looked freshly painted. We had a large comfortable king bed (though the pillows were a little on the firm side for our liking) and enjoyed having the full kitchenette (even complete with a wine opener ;-). All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful throughout our stay.We were on the third floor, directly across from the bar mentioned in previous posts (I had it confused with the piano bar behind the hotel when I checked in and requested our room location). The first night we experienced the same noise referenced in other posts, but the next day I realized that the windows weren't fully latched. Once latched, the noise wasn't nearly as noticeable the second night and we got a good night sleep. We noticed no noise from inside the hotel. We also had massages with the spa in the hotel and they were very enjoyable as well.This is a great hotel for someone looking for something off the beaten path. It is very convenient to downtown and there are a number of coffee shops, bars and restaurants in the immediate neighborhood.",4
787,787,Had a great time       hallway,4
788,788,Nice touches.... We arrived at the Marqueen in the early hours after we moved from a noisy hotel downtown. The receptionist was very helpful and friendly and his colleague delivered a well earned bottle of wine promptly to the room.All of our family and friends were already at the hotel as we were there for a wedding. The location was within easy reach of the Space Needle and many bars and restaurants. We welcomed the use of a kitchen and found the 'little extras' which you could purchase from a basket in the room a nice touch. The staff were always courteous and friendly and turn down service was another nice touch.,5
789,789,"Charming in a fun neighborhood This place is in a great neighborhood. You can walk and explore and catch the monorail downtown. We had a blast and hope to return again. We highly recommend this hotel for it's location, price, charm, uniqueness and proximity to fun.",5
790,790,Hipster Feel       The TV cabinet in the MarQueen room,4
791,791,"Love It!!!! We spent a romantic weekend in Seattle the weekend before Christmas and stayed here. We absolutely loved it!!! Cons: Tricky to find if you are not used to Seattle. There is no restaurant physically inside the hotel. You have to go outside and around the back to the restaurant they use. There is no guest parking. Common problem in Seattle though. You have to pay to park and since the hotel itself only allows Valet, you might have to pay to park in a lot up the way a bit. Pros: It is an old hotel so it has a lot of old charm. The room we had was absolutely wonderful! It was HUGE!!!! Hard wood floors, had a nice bathroom with cool old style tub. A little sitting room for breakfast with a full size fridge, stove, dishes, etc...there is also a little sitting area (think small living room) with a couch and two chairs and a table. The bed was very comfy. There are plenty of things to do right outside of the hotel. Nice restaurants, friendly neighborhood pubs, shopping. It was clean, it was cozy and we loved it. It's only a few minutes in a cab from the Space Needle and the Warf. If you are brave enough to get out and walk in the weather it's only about 15 minutes walk down to the Warf. The staff are super friendly and more than willing to help you find your way around the city. The restaurant that they use for guests does do room service, but again, you have to go outside. Oh, and in the room, there is a coat/linen closet. Now, it didn't bother us, but some people might find it odd. When you open the door, you see two cozy robes, towels, pillows, and then you will notice that it's actually the hot water heater room. It's quite large but dark. I wouldn't recommend letting kids play in there! I think the building itself was at one time an apartment building and that explained some of the funky things you see in the rooms and building.I highly recommend trying it if you like quirky, old style buildings. It's a lot of fun.",5
792,792,"A New Family Tradition I booked my stay at the MarQueen Hotel in Seattle, WA with the assistance of TripAdvisor and via Expedia. This was a first in every catagory. I depended on the reviews in making my hotel selection. It is with this in mind that I write my review today. We had a fabulous 3 day stay at the MarQueen. We have decided to return yearly as a new family tradition. Checking in was easy. The front desk clerks were friendly and knowledgeable of the hotel and area surroundings. The rooms were large and immaculate. For fun, I even did the white glove test and didn't find a bit of dust. The hotel has been well renovated with attention to every detail. The kitchen and bathroom space was very quaint and efficient. It was a nice change from the typical hotel chains. You couldn't ask for a better location to all the Seattle attractions. It took my family 35 mins to walk to Pike Place Market. Great morning exercise. Loaded with shopping bags, we took the Number 18 Bus back, which dropped us off at the hotel, 8-10 minutes later. I look forward to our visit next December. We'll need two rooms as more family members plan on coming.",5
793,793,"A little old-fashioned, but charming The room was very spacious, and had a charming, vintage feel. There was no elevator, which we didn't realize when we booked, so it was kind of a drag climbing the stairs with bags, but the exercise was good for us! There's a very good (and sometimes busy) coffee shop next door, accessible through the lobby, which was a nice convenience. I liked the area very much, kind of off the main tourist track, with some cute restaurants and shops nearby.Drawbacks were lack of onsite parking--we had to wait for the valet to retrieve the car each time we needed it--and no wi-fi--it took one of the staff many trips to figure out how to connect our laptop to the internet with the ethernet cable they supplied. Overall, I liked the Marqueen, and would recommend it for someone who likes something different and a bit funky.",3
794,794,"good value, more apartment than hotel... I was in Seattle for work and wanted to find a good value compared to the expensive conference hotels downtown. The Marqueen provides good value and is more of a European style hotel, except the rooms are actually more like large studio apartments including a kitchenette, large bath and walk-in closet.The bed and linens were comfortable and the hotel is located in lower Queen Anne in close proximity to some great bars and restaurants, but it is not walking distance to downtown and public transportation options are limited. There is a great coffee shop attached to the hotel and but no restaurant -- no need in this area of the city.This hotel is for a particular type of client. If you are looking for a Sheraton or Holiday Inn, this is not your type of place. If you want a friendly and home-like atmosphere with lots of room to rest your weary body -- then this is your place. PS Noticed no particular musty smells in the lobby or the room and I am usually VERY sensitive to these things.",3
795,795,"Pleasant Stay Spent a week in Seattle staying at the Marqueen, handy for the Seattle Centre and Space Needle and only a monorail ride or quick bus trip to the heart of downtown with plenty of bars and restuarants in the area if you want to eat locally.Rooms are big and come with a fully equipped kitchen and mine was comfortable and clean. Plumbing was rather antiquated but eveything worked which was the important thing. Front desk staff were attentive and helpful and happy to provide advice and guidance on local amenities. If you're a light sleeper I suggest you ask for a room at the rear, my room was at the front as the proximity of the main road and bars and restaurants means some late night noise, particularly at the weekend. It didn't stop me getting a good nights sleep, more of an issue was the noise from the fridge in the kitchen which I found it best to turn off overnight.Overall, I'd be happy to stay again at this well-appointed and individual hotel.",4
796,796,"Customer Service was terrific I read all the reviews, but questioned if they were planted or for real. Well, they were for real. Everything we asked for was taken care of immediatly. It was as if the desk staff knew what we wanted before asking. Loved the room, especially the kitchen and small reading/parlor. Robes were provided as well as coffee and tea. We did some shopping at the market down the street which saved us a few dollars on food but don't miss Peco's restaurant across the street. They have a Happy Hour breakfast between 9:00am and 11:am with just about anything on the menu for $6.00. Lots of other dining options within a few short blocks. Should we return to Seattle, this will be our first stop.",5
797,797,"Hotel Air Quality Alert The service at the front counter and valet was above average. The hotel has a very bad smell as soon as you enter. The smell is musty/ moldy and is not only at the entrance but in the room we stayed in room 214. The excuse by the front desk employee was that the woman's rest room on the first was the cause of the odor and it comes and goes. The bed mattress needs to be updated. Air flow / ventalation needs to be examined - the A/C was a window type that was not adequate for the room size. The daily valet was pricey at $18 per day. The Space Needle was within 10-15 minute walk- would not suggest taking a family on the walk in the evening hours as some of the street people gave us concerns. Overall, an ok stay- if you have allergies or do not like the grandma musty/ moth ball smells suggest paying a little extra to get better air quality.",3
798,798,"A great start to our trip My friends and I stayed here at the start of a road trip to California - a great way to start our trip! The MarQueen is a beautiful period hotel with lots of original features. The staff are really helpful and there was a free wine reception the first night we were there. Our room was large and very comfortable. The kitchen area is great , there's air con, TV, WIFI, a seperate sitting area etc. We also found it to be a great location for exploring Seattle - great restraunts right opposite and walking distance to the Space Needle. Compared to other hotels in Seattle - very good value too!",5
799,799,"Perfect for a bride/groom and guests! My husband and I chose the Marqueen as our wedding hotel in July. After talking with almost every other hotel in seattle, the Marqueen had the best rates for the rooms/amenities (they also run a stay 3 nights, get the 4th free- check out their website for these deals!), excellent location and were amazingly easy to work with. They offered us a small block of rooms without needing a guaranteed %, and being a detail fanatic, I went back and forth with the guest service manager MANY times and he was always super nice. They also left us a bottle of champagne in our room the night of our wedding! Very thoughtful. The rooms are like small apartments- the pictures posted by previous guests are very accurate and we also stayed in room 202 (has a nice view out the front of the hotel onto 1st?). They have a small kitchenette, built in dining space, huge bedroom and a small sitting room. We used 202 as the brides getting ready room, and it housed all the people and comer/goers without ever feeling crammed.The marqueen itself is an older building with great architecture and light, so we also took our 'first sight' pictures here before we headed off to the wedding as bride/groom. What I like most about hotels, once they have the basics down (large room, clean, internet, etc) is the service. And with a bellman to help you the second your car pulls up, and who opens/closes the front doors for you every time you arrive, and the front desk who were very nice... the marqueen adds the extra touch you're looking for! Esp during your wedding weekend.Other details: - Only drawback (for some, but I didnt think so) is that they dont serve breakfast. But you have a kitchenette or Pesos across the street has very yummy breakfasts! - Very close to multiple restaurants on lower queen anne, 2 large grocery stores, a Kits Camera (which came in handy), dry cleaners, Kinkos and 2 starbucks- all within a 4 block radius of the marqueen.- Super clean rooms and the maids were really good about not disturbing all our wedding stuff, yet still organizing the room during service.- They have a downtown shuttle which was awesome (fyi- the marriott on lake union doesnt have a shuttle- we had some guests staying there and overall, were disappointed).- Parking was easy, although we valeted with the hotel most of the time for minimally more. - FREE internet, which also worked well/fast! Hooray.* I didnt notice an elevator for older guests or handicapped, although there might have been one. But they do have rooms on the first floor.Overall, 5 stars and we highly recommend the Marqueen! Enjoy.(I havnt added our own pics, as room 202 was already posted by another reviewer, and we were quite messy in our room! But their pictures are very good and truly show the room as we had it as well)",5
800,800,"very charming hotel We stayed at the MarQueen hotel for just one night  it was wonderful. Previous reviews mentioned the noise from the front of the hotel so I requested a room on the 3rd floor at the back and it was very quiet. It was a 5 minute walk to the Seattle Rep Theater, with lots of restaurants to choose from along the way.Our room was quite large with hardwood floors, crown molding  no musty smell whatsoever. The room and the hotel overall was very clean and beautiful.",4

802,802,"Close..but no sigar. Stayed at Marqueen for a week. Expensive. Different experience than staying at the typical hotel-chains. More charming. Variable service from front-desk, but mostly positive and helpfull staff. Room (211) was spacius and quite (asked for quite room, and got it), but no view. Window faced a brick wall. Probably better in 3 floor.Cleaning could have been better, and the hotel in general should soon have a general clean-up.Close location to space needle and Belltown.",3
803,803,"Great location This hotel has great service, and most rooms have a full kitchen which was great since there is no breakfast at the hotel. Across the street, Pesos, serves great breakfasts for $6 M-F. Pesos is also a great night spot every night of the week, so if you go to sleep early, don't get a room on Queen Anne. Up the hill on Queen Anne is a great area for breakfast and shopping boutiques. The hotel is also on the 18 bus route, which takes you to Belltown, Ballard and downtown.",4
804,804,"Loved the hotel At first I was a little hesitant about staying at the hotel. The hotel itself is fine, but the people at the bar outside can be a little loud. In retrospect, I am so glad I chose to stay. This hotel has some of the nicest front desk people I have ever met. One person, Kris, in particular was fantastic. He always greeted us when we passed by. Even if it was 3 or 4 times in 15 minutes. He was personable and professional and always had a smile on his face. Each night when we walked through the lobby he offered to set up a wake up call for us, instead of waiting for us to ask for one.The rest of the staff was just as good. Plus the location is perfect. Try to get a quiet room because of the noise from accross the street, but if one isn't available, remember that the bar closes at 2am, so it should be quiet after that. I highly recommend you stay at the Mar Queen Hotel.",5
805,805,"Good old hotel The Marqueen is in an old building with a long and illustrious history. At various times it's been a Ford worker complex (turn of the century), an apartment building and an opium den. : )Now it has been restored as a old world feel hotel which definitely lacks the lustre and shine of the new and the modern but still has it's charm. The suites are spacious with tall ceilings, original hardwood floors, new bathrooms and original kitchens with massive cupboards. Not all the suites are flawless - some still have carpeting over the hardwood for instance, and there is some must in the air, but it's not unexpected or bad, and the work is not finished. The furnishings have an antique feel to them, there is free wi-fi, robes and the best, most helpful staff I have ever seen. They were truly outstanding ensuring the stay was a great experience. You can't beat the value for the price for a downtown Seattle hotel. All the great things downtown are within walking distance and the one cab ride we felt was required was only ten dollars. If you're not the kind of person to be put off by an older feeling room it's great value, but if you need shiny surfaces and modern furnishings this is not the place for you.",4
806,806,"Fantastic hotel, great for wedding guests We used the Marqueen and its sister hotel the Inn at Queen Anne as recommendations for our out-of-town guests at our October 2006 wedding. Our bridal party also stayed here, and my husband and I stayed in one of the large suites they use as the bridal suite. The Marqueen is very charming, with an old world feel, and extremely affordable (with or without a wedding discount). We loved the furnishings and the design of the rooms. And the price was just unbeatable! The whole staff was super nice as well. Also Queen Anne is an ideal neighborhood if you are visiting Seattle, cute and charming with easy access to Seattle Center and Downtown. Everyone we spoke to in our wedding party had a good experience there. The suite we stayed in was huge and beautiful, with a kitchenette, eatingarea, living room, and huge bed. If you are looking to block rooms for a wedding at an affordable place in Seattle, the good people at the Marqueen are a joy to work with. And if you are just looking for an affordable hotel in a great neighborhood, something more interested than the holiday inn, this is a fantastic choice.",5

808,808,"Shabby...not shabby-chic I stayed at the MarQueen for business the week of March 19th. Positives: As noted by other reviewers, the room was large, including a kitchenette, large sleeping area, walk-in closet and average sized bathroom. The service was excellent: attentive and efficient. And, the hotel itself is in a good location, with lots of restaurants nearby, and it is just a couple of blocks to attractions like the Space Needle, Key Arena, and others. Negatives: Again as noted by other reviewers, the place smells. A musty, stale, smell hangs over the lobby, and exists throughout the hotel. The lobby itself has a run-down look, as did my room. Threadbare rugs on floors, worn hardwood, all the polish off the bathtub, bathroom floor tile in desperate need of re-grouting, worn doorhandles, creaky floors....the list goes on. I get that the motif is going for a jazz age atmosphere, but I've been in hotels that manage character without looking, feeling, and smelling worn. Warnings: A couple of things didn't bother me, but might put off other travellers. First, there's no elevator (the hotel has only 3 floors). Second, my room at the front of the hotel was subject to a good deal of street noise: the street outside seems a busy thoroughfare for cars, and the restaurants/night spots seemed to spit out handfuls of loud (but not rowdy) crowds each night. Not overbearing noise, but noticeable. Booking through Expedia cost me about $160/night. Not expensive for the location, but given that there were other hotels nearby also in that price range, I have a feeling there's a better option in the neighbourhood than the MarQueen.",2
809,809,"Unique Hotel with lots of character My husband, teenage son and I stayed here over the weekend as the boys were going to a Sonics game. They were able to walk a few blocks to the Key Arena. The valets were excellent! Best service we have ever seen. They opened doors, carried baggage, parked our car, and generally hopped to our every need. Parking is $18 per night, but that is reasonable for a Seattle city hotel. Once you step into the lobby of the MarQueen, you know it's old. It's got beautiful wood floors, large chandeliers, velvet drapes and antique furniture. Our room was much of the same... polished, creaky wooden floors; a long kitchen with a booth to eat breakfast and a full refrigerator/microwave; a small living room with a loveseat and recliner; and comfy beds. There was also loads of Seattle Magazines on the coffee table. We found great places to see and eat at in those magazines. I used the monorail to get to the downtown shopping area. You can also ride the bus or take a taxi. Parking is terrible downtown. The hotel has a car that will take you places as well. (they don't promise they can pick you up however). Cafe Ladro (next door) has the Best soy latte I have ever had. They also have pies, quiche, muffins and soup. If you like brand new hotels ...then this one won't be for you. If you are like me and appreciate the character and history of these older hotels, then try the MarQueen. We'll be going back!",4
810,810,Great location/Good Value       View From Kerry Park,4
811,811,"A beautiful and elegant Hotel We stayed at the Marqueen and just loved it. The room was spacious and elegant, (although we moved some of the furniture to make it work for us). The service was excellent, over and above what is necessary. A courtesy car to wherever we wanted, courteous people at the front desk, who were knowledgable and friendly, and wonderful restaurants all around us.We will certainly be returning.Judy Treloar",5
812,812,"Lots of character! We stayed at the Marqueen Hotel this past long weekend, Nov 10th - 13th. We were specifically looking for a hotel with a kitchenette. The property is an old heritage apartment building which used to house GM employees. We checked in late Friday night and the staff was friendly and helpful. The bellman/valet (same guy) helped us carry our bags to our room. We booked into a junior suite and having read the reviews on here, made sure we asked for the quietest room available on the third floor. Our suite was large and spacious with a lot of character to it. Nice wooden floors, HUGE closet space, clean with high ceilings and the kitchenette even has enough room for a small eating area! The room had a really nice vibe. The only downside was the decor, it really could use some updating (ie. the drapery, bedding and couch). The bath was decent. Shower pressure was so-so...soaps and shampoos were provided. The kitchen was adequate, wished they had more usable pots and pans as what we had was quite old. We tried making eggs but the non-stick pan basically ate up half of the eggs. The cleaning staff cleaned up all the dirty dishs and pots as they do not provide dish detergent. Conveniently connected to the lobby is the Cafe Ladro which is a fantastic coffee shop. It's a small chain (not affiliated with the hotel) and the coffees are the best I've had in Seattle. Similar to Cafe Artigiano quality if you're from Vancouver. As for the noise that a lot of people have complained about, it was definitely there but that's just staying downtown and recommend using earplugs if you're a light sleeper. The suite is not super quiet! I found the bed and pillows to be a bit hard for my tastes but that's personal preference. We also used the valet parking service which worked great although it was an additional $18 bucks a day. So some pros and cons, the place isn't for everyone but if you like staying at places with some character and not the usual hotel chain we would really recommend this place. All in all we definitely liked the place and would stay there again.",4
813,813,"Great Hotel Very unique hotel. Great deal, great location, excellent atmosphere. Upgrading to their corner suites was well worth the money. Many restaurants within walking distance, taxi cabs are also well worth it (parking in downtown Seattle is horrid).Overall a great hotel, and a great change from the ordinary.",5
814,814,"The noise spoiled it My wife and I booked one night at the Inn at Queen Anne in September 2006. The Inn at Queen Anne is the sister hotel of the MarQueen Hotel. Even though we had booked our room five months in advance, upon arrival we were told that they did not have a room for us but advised they had booked us into the MarQueen around the corner.The MarQueen is an old style hotel. There was very limited parking out front but we were lucky enough to get a park whilst we unloaded our bags. Fortunately for us, we were taking the car back to the rental depot so didn't have to worry about parking.The room we were given was large with a separate kitchen and lounge. The kitchen had a microwave and fridge. There was a large TV with all the usual channels.Everything was really good until we turned off the TV to go to bed. It was then that we heard the noise from the music and the people across the road at a restaurant/club. The noise got progressively louder. We rang the desk to find out how long it goes for and were advised 2.00 am. They offered to ring the establishment if we wanted (couldn't imagine that working) or we could use the ear plugs in the 'honour bar' (at a cost - I think it was $1).The fact that they had ear plugs available made me think that this is a regular occurrence. We certainly were not forewarned by the staff. Just as we were told, the noise continued until just after 2.00 am.Breakfast was not provided at this hotel.As you can imagine, we were not overjoyed at initially being turned away from the hotel we booked, only to be sent to another hotel ( allegedly a higher rating) where we were kept awake until 2.00 am.Considering the stuff ups, I was concerned we may have been charged the higher rate at the MarQueen, than our initial hotel, so I enquired at the desk. We were then advised that, because of the mix up with the bookings, we would not be charged at all. We thought that was good public relations considering what had occurred.",3
815,815,"Handy Hotel - Close to Space Needle This is a good value hotel in the trendy Queen Anne district of Seattle. The rooms are large and spacious, ours had a kitchen and lounge ( left over from when the building used to be apartments I believe ). The hotel has lots of character, unlike the bland appearance of the big chains.The staff were friendly and helpful, the doorman happily got us a taxi first thing in the morning before we set off.The hotel is surrounded by a few coffee shops, bars and restaurants, which was nice at it saved going back into town in the evening.A nice hotel in a nice part of town, we had a very enjoyable stay.",4
816,816,"Seattle must have better than this As previous reviewers have rightly said, the rooms are huge and ours also came with a kitchen but they are the only positives we could draw from our stay. The hotel has an all-pervading stale smell and this extended to our bed which smelled as if the previous occupants were feline! We probably should have checked out after one night but we only had one full day in Seattle and we didn't want to waste it searching for a hotel. On our second night we worked out that if you leave the fan on the smell isn't quite as overpowering. While the Marqueen is within 10-15 minutes walk of downtown Seattle there must be better hotels more centrally located for the $175 per night plus tax that we paid. We are not going back to this hotel and would not recommend it to friends.",2
817,817,Rooms are huge and each have a kitchen!       Newly-renovated bath,5
818,818,"Affordably Elegant If you don't need an elevator, this is a wonderful find in the Queen Anne district near Seattle Center. My room on the third floor was enormous, with separate well stocked kitchen and eating nook, living area with large couch, and recessed king sized bed, all very elegant and comfortable. Highly recommended.",5
819,819,"MarQueen Hotel was perfect for us. If you need a hotel with a kitchen and want something with a little elegance and history, then the MarQueen is for you. The staff was wonderful and sent us in the right direction for wonderful seafood (Anthony's) and made sure everything was just so. The location is great for walking almost everywhere (you might want a taxi to Chinatown, which in my opinion was not worth the trip if you've been to NY and San Fran.)",4
820,820,"Great room but don't stay here if you can't handle noise My boyfriend and I stayed at the Marqueen in early June 2006. I'm ranking the Marqueen as above average because we had a lovely room and the hotel staff members were very helpful and friendly. However, this was the noisiest hotel that I have ever visited as our room was at the front of the building and directly faced Peso's restaurant/nightclub. Based on hotel reviews I knew this might be a problem so I called the hotel a couple of days prior to our arrival to request a room at the back of the hotel. I was told by a very polite staff member that, because we booked on Hotwire, my request would be prioritized accordingly. We arrived at 11 pm on a Friday evening and Peso's nightclub was in full swing. Once we arrived I repeated my request but was told that the hotel was fully booked and that our room was at the front of the hotel. Thank goodness we were tired and that we are both hard sleepers, because this is a very noisy street. We also had the pleasure of seeing a bar patron puking on the street and hearing at least one drunken argument. Saturday night was a repeat of Friday.On the plus side, the room was nicely furnished and we loved having a full kitchen. This would be a great place to stay with young children if you got a quiet room. If I were going to stay here again I would book with the hotel directly to ensure that I got a quieter room.",4
821,821,"Balky shower, otherwise great Good hotel. Very large rooms. Excellent service. My main issue was that the shower, which was very old (as is the hotel), fluctuated in temperature quite a bit. It would get cold and then be scalding the next second. And it is an antique-y sort of hotel, so if you don't like that sort of thing, I would stay away. All around, above average hotel stay.",5
822,822,"Very Nice Stay! We just got back from staying at the MarQeen Hotel and had a wonderful stay there! The hotel is located in a really neat neighborhood and there are plenty of places to grab a bite to eat and drink. We really liked the restaurant attached to the hotel. The hotel also has coupons for free appitizers at several places within walking distance. One of the best things about the hotel is the free car service. You need to ask the front desk for this and they have to schedule it for you, though we never waited more than 10 minuets for the car to come if we asked for it at that very moment. They will take you anywhere but the airport (it seemed) for free. The Public Market is less than 10 minuetes away and they will pick you up as well! The room is like a miny studio apartment. Highly recommend staying at the MarQueen. It is a really nice change from the typical chain hotel and it is a great value. Check out the website for specials. Loved the Queen Anne neighborhood and surrounding area!!",4
823,823,"Liked the Marqeen alot. Just got back from a 4 night stay at the Marqueen and would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Seattle, especially tourists who would like to see all the sights. We were walking distance to the Space Needle and the Experimental Music Project. Pike Place Market and Pioneer Square are not walking distance, however we did a very short 5-10 minute walk to the waterfront and took a free shuttle to Pioneer Square. This used to be the trolley, but they tore this down apparantly. We didn't know this and were looking for the trolley when we came across the free shuttle bus signs.Our room was very comfortable. Our only complaint was that it was a smoking room and since all the non-smoking rooms were booked, we could not switch. This was not the hotel's fault though, I really should have called ahead and requested a non-smoking room. Our room did face Queen Anne Blvd on the first floor and I was worried that there would be noise, esp since we would be staying Friday and Sat night, but it did not interfere with our sleep. We had a very nice kitchenette, which my husband set up as an office with his laptop. This was great as he could work on the computer and not bother me while I was sleeping. The cofffee was the best in room coffee we have ever had. I could not wait to make the first cup every morning!We did not eat at 10 Mercer, which is the restaurant attached to the hotel, but the attached coffee shop was wonderful. Racha, a Thai restaurant around the corner was a highlight of dining on this trip. There are alot of other restaurants within a few blocks of the hotel. You have to repeat anything on just a four or five night trip.",4
824,824,"Fun, charming and just what we needed - only a few issues We stayed at the MarQueen for five days in March '06 on a tourist trip to Seattle - we had every intention of hitting all the tourist sites, having traveled to Seattle on business several times before. The MarQueen's location is PERFECT for anything at Seattle Center - Space Needle, EMP, Sci Fi Museum, Children's Museum, the theaters (Intiman, Seattle Rep), McCaw Hall, and Key Arena. It's a charming neighborhood with good restaurants around (some great, some not so good, so the selection does wear thin after a few days).The rooms are well appointed - having a kitchen is GREAT. We ate in the room often rather than going out and Larry's Market right near by made for some good, fresh meals.The staff is the most friendly and helpful I've seen in awhile. Very knowledgeable and friendly without being fake. Quick with a recommendation or anything you need. Cannot say enough good things about the staff. Really made the stay worthwhile. The weekend staff, however, was not as friendly and helpful.The drawbacks -- the bed was THE most uncomfortable we've ever slept in and the pillows were flat and hard. It does get loud if there's an event at Key Arena or some of the bars across the street, especially on the weekend; avoid a room on the first floor facing the street at all costs. If you don't like stairs, avoid a room on the third floor, too. There is no elevator, and after walking around all day that gets tiring. However, on a clear day the views from a third floor room facing the street are gorgeous.You are not close enough to downtown - Pike Place or the waterfront. We did walk it a couple of times and it isn't terrible, but not advisable. We did use the shuttle several times, which is terrific, but if it's not available you're stuck. You can schedule from the hotel in advance, but you can't schedule a pick up from down town in advance, so you have to take your chances. The weekend staff was not at all helpful in that regard and kept recommending we take a bus. We got back to the hotel and found the shuttle available. The shuttle is a really nice addition, though, and does make getting around easier - if you're able to schedule it.All in all, it's a very nice place to stay. It is showing its age a little bit, but it is charming and much better than a chain motel with bland rooms and decor. Would definitely recommend the MarQueen and would stay there again.",4
825,825,"Still very good Just spent five days with family at the Marqueen. Great location, great hotel. Comfortable beds, very spacious, the kitchen (even a table!) and sitting room perfect for a long stay. Staff excellent, great value. Highly recommended!",5
826,826,"Gorgeous hotel Great hotel, huge, elegant rooms. Very clean, and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Fantastic value for money, great location, very interesting views of Seattle from the window, two seconds away from Seattle Center. Would recommend to anybody.",5
827,827,"Quaint and enjoyable If you like older hotels, this place is for you. Personally, I enjoy the opportunity to stay somewhere otehr than the manufactured busisiness hotels. Enjoyed a one night stay at the MarQueen. I booked one of the corner suites for $160 on Orbitz. My suite was a nice self contained apartment that had high speed internet, a desk, a sitting room, bedroom, etc. On the whole a very enjoyable stay. If you are bringing lots of luggage, you may want a room on a lower floor as there is no elevator. I travel light so this was not an issue for me.",4
828,828,"Great Location, Great Poeple We love funky hotels and tend to stay away from the big box brands. And, we love staying in the neighborhoods instead of the downtown or airport locations. This hotel fit our tastes perfectly. A coverted apartment house, it offers the largest, most inviting rooms I think I have ever seen in a hotel. Ours had a sitting area with couch, chair, reading lamp, and coffee table; a huge bedroom, furnished kitchen, and bath with tub/shower. It was like a small apartment. The bed was very comfy; something I have a hard time finding and am very critical of. We just found the room warn and inviting from the minute we stepped in. The staff was young, friendly, and knowledgeable about the area. We loved the feeling of the Queen Anne neighborhood with its numerous dining establishments and shops. It is very convenient to catch a bus right across from the hotel to anywhere in Seattle. We didn't bother with a car. One small drawback. It is near Key Arena. One night we were awakened at 2 P.M. by noisy Sonics fans departing the bar across the street. This could be remedied by requesting a room in back. I tried to do this but one was not available for all 3 nights that we stayed. That said, we will definitely use this property again for future visits to Seattle.",5
829,829,"Charming and Great Value at Marqueen Stayed at the Marqueen Aug 15-21. Found the staff to be most accommodating, holding our room for one night when our flight was cancelled and not charging for the night's cancellation. Received the third floor, back of hotel room as requested when booking on their internet site. Rooms are quite large with convenient full kitchen, which came in handy when staying for a week and bringing home goodies from Pike Place Market. Great location for any Seattle Center events, opera, etc. About a 20-25 minute walk to the Market and downtown, which we enjoyed. Coming home uphill was a challenge on some warm days. However, the monorail is a convenient 2 block walk, although we did not use it. The walk up three flights of stairs could also become a chore if not in decent shape. All in all, though, we found it a great value (at 157/night), and we were attending the opera for four nights, so the location couldn't be beat. The coffee shop was wonderful, and we also enjoyed 10 Mercer for both dinner and just appetizers and drinks after the opera. Very clean. Close to transportation. Even offers a car into town, which we didn't use. We rented a car for the last two nights we were there and parked on the street two blocks away to save the valet fee and hassle when we wanted to use the car. Would return for the same price.",4
830,830,"A good choice The Marqueen is the place to stay if you're going to the Key Arena or other Seattle Center venues, which are a short walk away. The building is a refurbished apartment house, so the rooms are bigger than the usual hotel room, with a full size kitchen and a separate sitting area. Our room was elegantly furnished and the bed was very comfortable. The staff was very cordial and gave us several suggestions that helped us during our trip. There was even a wine-tasting event the night we stayed there.A couple of things to keep in mind:1. There is no elevator, but a bellman assisted us with our luggage. Unfortunately, he did not offer to pick me up and carry me up three flights, so I had to remind myself that exercise is good for me. No big deal for me, but it might be for you.2. There are a coffee bar (ie, not a coffee shop) and a trendy bar next to the hotel, but nothing within the hotel as you might find with the big chains. Again, no big deal. The neighborhood is kinda funky and pleasant, and I did not have to walk far to find good places to eat breakfast and dinner. 3. This hotel is not downtown and not within walking distance to Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square, or the business district, but it is right by the Seattle Center, with the entertainment venues, museums, and Space Needle, and the Monorail, which takes you right downtown in 5 minutes. Other forms of public transportation seemed to be plentiful and convenient.Enjoy Seattle!",4
831,831,"good hotel--great location This hotel has a lot of charm; rooms are not too big, but they have a kitchenette and sitting area. The lobby is lovely. The hotel staff was very, very friendly and helpful. This hotel is in a great location for walking to Seattle Center, the EMP, Space Needle, etc. The staff was very helpful in directing us down to the waterfront by bus, a very easy and convenient trip.This hotel is near many good restaurants and several nice markets. We stayed here with two children and it worked out very well.",4
832,832,"Old world charm in trendy neighborhood I stayed here for a conference that was in downtown Seattle. The room was vey large, like a small apartment. The kitchenette was a separate room with a small table, there was a walk in closet and good sized bathroom. If you like older places, not a chain, this your place. Plus the neighborhood is trendy and lots of things to walk to. Downtown Seattle clears out at night. The trolley that goes along the water is only 4 blocks away. I got the room for $89 via hotwire.",4
833,833,"Good deal! Nice and clean, neighborhood decent and close to space needle. Great places to eat in the area and all in walking distance. The kitchen saved us alot of money by being able make small meals. A grocery store was nearby. It was easy to take the bus everywhere.",4
834,834,"You Get A LOT for your $$$$ This hotel is one of the best I've ever stayed in! The rooms are all suites with their own full kitchen. The rooms are very roomy and comfortable. Our room was very clean and the staff were really friendly and accomodating. Bath robes are provided standard in each room, which for us is a little added luxury. The bed was comfortable and there were many cable channels available in our room. Also, each room had internet access for your laptop.The location was conveniently located within walking distance from the space needle. And surrounded by many small businesses consisting of various restaurants and boutiques, as well as a convenience store around the corner. The bus stops across the street and takes you into downtown and the football and baseball stadiums. We saved on parking by paying $2.50 bus fare and got on and off the bus throughout the day with the same ticket.The only thing that might be a setback is that there are no great views from the room, if you intend to stay there and look out a window. The place is old in style, somewhat like an old San Francisco apartment, but it is kept in great condition. The hotel charges $15 a night for parking, but you can find free parking off the street after 6pm to avoid paying these charges.",5
835,835,"One of my favorite hotels in Seattle I stay in Seattle hotels a lot; I live about 30 miles south, and staying in the downtown area hotels is one of my favorite little indulgences for birthdays, anniversaries, and other special occasions. I've stayed at the Marqueen on four separate occasions, and have been very happy with it each time. I've always paid in the range of $130 booking online, and feel that's a reasonable value for this part of town.There's no elevator, but it's only a few floors, so that's not a big deal to me. The grand staircase is elegant and very impressive. The lobby staff and valets have always been very helpful and polite to me.In every hotel, I request highest floor possible, quiet room. This has always been accommodated at the Marqueen. Rooms on Queen Anne Avenue can be quite noisy, especially at 2 a.m. when the bars across the street disgorge their patrons. I recommend asking for top floor. The other side of the hotel is quieter, but the Queen Anne side has partial views of Elliott Bay in some rooms.The rooms are quite wonderful; they're HUGE. I've lived in smaller apartments. They're old and the heating and plumbing is ancient, so don't expect everything to be perfect. The decor is very nicely done with comfortable antiques. The kitchenettes in every room are part of the reason I keep returning: I love having the separate breakfast area, the microwave, refrigerator and sink.I'm trying to remember if I've ever heard other guests at the Marqueen. I'm very fussy about that; I hate hearing other guests' TVs, conversations in the halls, doors slamming, etc., and I don't think that's ever been an issue here.There's tons of great places to eat within a block of the hotel. My personal favorite is Pagliacci Pizza, right across the street; it's a habit with me to order a pizza and salads as soon as I check in, then bring them back to enjoy in my room. There's also an excellent grocery store (Larry's Market) within two blocks.It can take quite awhile for the valets to fetch your car for you, so make sure to call in plenty of time if you're heading to something with a specific start time. They usually only have one or two valets on call. They do guarantee your parking space if you take your car out during your stay (not all downtown hotels do, even with the exorbitant fees).",4
836,836,"Great place for the price We stayed here Jan. 21, 2005 and had a great time. The valet parking was easy (even with a Sonics game going on nearby and tons of traffic). The lobby is very quaint and old fashioned, but we did have to walk up stairs to the 3rd floor since they don't have an elevator. They were willing to help carry our bag, though, which we declined since the gentleman was much older than my husband. The room was huge as far as Seattle hotels go, with a separate kitchen area, huge walk-in closet and large sleeping area. Our room faced a busy street (Queen Anne Ave.) with night clubs and restaurants, so we knew right away to go buy earplugs at the drugstore up the street. With those in we slept like babies. There is a coffee shop connected to the hotel which served us the best mocha in the world (don't remember the name but it's accessible through the inside of the hotel). We walked a few blocks to the Seattle Center and hopped on the monorail to take us downtown to shop (which is what you should do if you want to explore Pike Place like a previous poster mentioned- the monorail gets you within a 10 minute walk of the waterfront and market). We had a great time here- we liked the old fashioned charm of the place, it was clean, close to everything in Seattle either by walking or monorail, safe neighborhood, and cheap for us through Hotwire. I wouldn't recommend it for older folks who can't walk very far, because of the stairs and everything in Seattle being best accessed on foot. We'd definitely stay there again though.",4
837,837,"Strongly recommend finding alternate lodging in Seattle!! My wife and I thought this would be a nice charming hotel with a lot of character, but were extremely disappointed when we arrived.The room was dumpy, noisy and literally had a haze of smoke in it. We could barely even breathe in this room. When we asked downstairs for a different, preferrably non-smoking room, we were told there were none available. While we discussed our options, we watched the clerk actually check in three other guests. I asked if they were given non-smoking rooms, and the answer was yes. Apparently we could not have one of those rooms, even though we arrived first, since we booked through Orbitz.Also, since we booked through Orbitz, they would not discount or refund our charges. Ultimately, we found a different hotel and ended up paying for a room where we could not and did not stay. I agree with one of the previous reviews that this place is a gouging rip off!!! I wish I would have checked this board before booking.",1
838,838,"Charming despite old building My husband just stayed 4 nights at this hotel. We loved the charm and looks of this hotel, and the staff was very nice and accomodating. The location was not bad (near the Space Needle and EMP), but for people who want to walk to places such as Pike Place, it's definitely a good hike. The only real downside to the hotel was the crickety, loud heater, which kept us up many a night, and the very low shower heads (very vintage). We'd likely stay there again, but I'd have to make sure there's a quiter heater.",3
839,839,"Charming if you like old buildings...great location though. Our review of the Marqueen Hotel.....Well let's see. It sounded great online. Plush robes, Valet Parking, etc. Overall, we weren't that impressed. 1.) No elevator. When you have been walking all day, the last thing you want is to walk up 5 flights of stairs. We lived.2.) Hard bed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Woke up everyday with a sore back.3.) The plumbing is a bit shady, but it is an old building. My shower went from Hot, to tepid, to cold, back to hot then to freezing before my shampoo was rinsed out.4.) Valet parking was overpriced. $15 per night, and our car never left their parking facility. We walked everywhere. What did I pay for?5.) The staff was friendly. We didn't get the snobbiness that others mention. We too did book online.6.) Location is great. Walking distance to Space Needle, etc. Our favorite restaurant The Melting Pot is right next door.We will try a new place to stay next time. This was our 3rd time spending time in Seattle and we have not found the perfect hotel yet.",2
840,840,"Overall, nice but has a few negatives We stayed at the Marqueen in October, 2004 after booking online. Overall, it was a good experience. The negatives were: snooty desk clerk at check-in (I had the definite impression that since we booked online, he thought we were second class citizens), room not being ready at 3:00 check-in time, and a noisy room (quite a bit of traffic noise). The positives were: pleasant and helpful staff other than our first check-in person, great location, and we were given a large suite with a little kitchen which was really nice. The hotel has alot of character and if you check around online, you can get a good price.",4
841,841,"MarQueen great for babies We stayed at the MarQueen for several days in August 2004. With a crawling baby, we were nervous about staying in a big city hotel. The MarQueen was perfect for us. The room was spacious enough to allow for the baby to sleep in one room while we talked in another. Our room had its own kitchen -- everything but a stove -- so we could feed the baby easily. Three grocery stores, a pharmacy, and a health clinic are all close-by, as is the Children's Museum, and great restaurants that have carry-out or are okay with kids. Staff were great, recommending family-friendly places and helping get the stroller in and out (the one downside is the lack of an elevator, but you can leave the stroller in a space in the lobby without problem). Having read some very critical reviews of the hotel, I was worried, but we had a great time. We would stay at the MarQueen again -- great location, friendly people, a home away from home.",4
842,842,"Great Value We stayed at the Marqueen for a few days and was pleasantly surprised by its value and service. Our room was spacious with a sitting area and an eat-in kitchen. Yes, the plumbing could be better, but it is an old building. It was so quiet (We had the room not facing the bar, obviously), I wondered whether there were any other guests on our floor. Finally, the staff was very friendly and provided excellent directions. I would definitely stay there again if I were to go back to Seattle.",4
843,843,"Worst Service Ever!!! Gouging Rip Off!!! We had a number of problems with our room and the way management handled our issues was worse - actually the worst we have ever seen. First, our mattress pad and mattress were very wet - we didn't notice this until going to bed, though called the front desk and were offered to have someone come up and change the sheets. It was already late and changing the sheets wouldn't help with the wet mattress and pad. We piled down all the towels and robes and tried to sleep. But then......Our room faced Queen Street, and was right across from a very loud bar. As closing time approached, the party and fights poured out onto the street. The noise lasted for hours and included people smashing bottles, loud swearing, car alarms going off, yelling - just a bunch of noise that the closed window and AC system couldn't possibly drown out. This happened both Friday and Saturday nights.We had an early morning meeting and when we returned after meetings, we asked the staff if someone had taken care of the bed. The person seemed to be the 'floor manager' in the lobby. He said he hadn't heard anything about the wet bed, but we said we'd already told two staff members about the problem. He didn't offer to do anything or give us another room and basically seemed defensive. He blamed us for leaving the 'do not disturb' sign on the door. There was no message for us saying anyone had tried to fix the problem either. After we raised it for the third time, we realized all we'd gotten was grief from them but no one bothered to do a thing. It was as if they knew the bed was wet and should be dry by now. When we checked out, we learned we'd been charged a 'last minute rate' ABOVE the published maximum rate. We brought that to the attention of the front desk staffer, and he said he couldn't do anything about it - that he had no authority. We asked to speak to someone with some authority, and another person came out from the back office. That person was very defensive about the pricing and we really felt like we were being taken to the cleaners. When we raised the issue of the wet bed that no one had tended to, as well as having the room right across from a noisy bar, we were offered free parking (a $30 value).We were expected to pay $255 per night, which is $30 higher than the maximum published price, and when they kept saying there was nothing they could or would do, we requested a discount for our troubles - and all we were met with was defensiveness and extreme rudeness. As a final insult, our car was parked outside in the hotel loading zone - since we were checking out and had just loaded our bags into the car in the proper area. While we spent over 20 minutes dealing with the front desk staff on the problems of pricing, the unresolved wet bed problem, and not being able to sleep being across from the bar, one of the bellman glared at us and then snarled DIRECTLY TO US saying that we were blocking traffic for incoming guests and causing a big traffic jam out on the street.We were appalled that our issues were blatantly ignored. It truly seemed that this place was in the business of ripping off guests and didn't care about their own reputation. I should add that we have stayed in hotels all over the world and have NEVER seen such rude service.After spending more than 20 minutes at the front desk, expecting a hefty discount (for their price gouging, the wet bed and the sleepless nights), we got frustrated that no one would do anything and we left our name for the manager to call. Five days later, the manager has not bothered to call us and we have put a call in to her but she hasn't returned our call either.We would never stay there again and will be certain to tell all of our friends about their poor ethics and lack of customer service. Had the hotel dealt with us in a professional, ethical manner, we would have been more understanding.",1
844,844,"Comfortable and friendly We dropped by chance into the MarQueen Hotel last month and felt very lucky to have picked it. The staff was friendly and professional. The studio-style room is a very good value and is well appointed. The location is very convenient to downtown, but there are so many pleasant restaurants within a few blocks, there's little need to venture outside the neighborhood, except for fun. We will definitely stay there again.",4
845,845,"Unequal treatment A friend and I stayed there about a year or two ago. I would have written a more timely review had I known about this site earlier. The key should have been when we checked in and the person helping us said, Oh, I see you made your reservations through Priceline..... The rooms actually were very nice and the price I thought reasonable.However, my friend had a problem with his shower, he got scalded because the hot water control did not work. In fact one night he could not turn the hot water off and maintenance had to respond to the room to fix it. He requested another room and was told they did not have any available. He then took bathes so that he at least knew how hot the water was going to be once he filled the tub. However, it turns out the plumbing leaked into the room below. Lo and behold when guests in the room below complained my friend was told he then had to move and they placed him into a magically appearing vacant room.The first day I arrived I had picked up a brochure and sent it to my parents. They had been looking for a place to stay in Seattle where they could take all the grandchildren and parents for a week or two. After the above experience I called them and told them to throw the brochure away! I feel had we been full price paying customers my friend would have not been treated so terribly. The manager offered my friend a bottle of wine, however, when my friend tried maintaining contact with the manager he was threaten with being reported for harassment. My friend's greatest disappointment was he was never apologized to, nor given an explanation as to why when he requested to move he couldn't. Only when another guest complained then he was told he had to move. It's a nice hotel, I suspect, if you pay full price and there's nothing wrong with your room. Otherwise, their idea of customer service can be scary!",1
846,846,Just like the movies!! My stay at the MarQueen was everything that I was hoping for. This Hotel is absolutely beautiful and is second only to the great staff . I felt like I was in one of those movies where the very wealthy live in the hotels. Please keep in mind that I travel for a living. When I travel I typically stay in modern or recently renovated cookie cutter hotels. I was skeptical about staying in a vintage hotel such as this one; however the MarQueen hotel is as classy and beautiful as they come. It is a true treasure and wonderful addition to an already marvelous city.,5
847,847,"Great Staff! As noted by several reviews, the Marqueen is located in a great section of the city. In exchange for chain stores and high-rises, the Queen Anne district is loaded with great restaurants  shops and has a neighborhood feel other parts of the city lack. Request a room that doesn't face the street if you are staying over a weekend. There is a pretty rowdy bar across the street that was quite noisy at 2am... But other than that, the staff was extremely friendly  helpful and the rooms were charming. YES, this is an old building and YES, the plumbing is a little sketchy, but if you are willing to sacrifice the sterility (and bordom) of the chain hotels, you will enjoy the personality of the Marqueen... I would absolutely stay here again!",4
848,848,"Perfect for our needs The Marqueen was a nice change from the typical boxy hotel room. If you like brand new everything this will not be for you, but if you love a sense of history you'll appreciate the Marqueen. On the advise of another Trip Advisor we asked for a room on the back side and were not bothered by noise - in fact we thought maybe we were the only ones there (not the case). Because it was once an apartment, there was a nice, equipped kitchen space. Its proximity to a market, good restaurants, Kerry Park, the Seattle Center and the Monorail made walking a workable option. The staff was very gracious.",5

861,861,Mayflower rocked Mayflower hotel rocked!Pros:- VERY friendly front desk staff- super close to shopping (across the street from Macy's and other shopping in downtown)- valet parking- Rooms were adequate sized and the very clean and detailed. We were surprisedCons:- Hit and Miss on the parking staff (two of the guys retreated into the hotel when we arrived in our taxi rather than helping us with our bags)We thorougly enjoyed our stay at mayflower. the location could not be beat. highly recommended for the price,5
862,862,"Excellent Hotel This is an older hotel so the rooms are not large. Bathroom was a little on the small side, as was the TV. Overall though, we really enjoyed our stay at the Mayflower. The bed in our room was very comfortable -- better than your average 3* hotel bed --  they also provided bathrobes. We stayed during a snowstorm so we really appreciated the fact that the hotel has a good restaurant (Andalucia -- Spanish tapas) with excellent food  reasonable prices. There's also quite a good bar. We found the staff to be very friendly  helpful, plus the hotel is in a great location right in the center of Seattle. I'd highly recommend this hotel as great value for money.",5
863,863,"Nice but small We spent a snowy night in Seattle, after attending the 5th ave Theatre in Seattle. It was a little walk which we enjoyed in the vibrant city. The room was small and not that great. The valet parking being included in the rate was a bonus. The location is close to everthing. We shopped and walked to the Market in the morning where we ate a fantastic breakfast overlooking the waterfront at Lowells in the Market.",4
864,864,"First Class Hotel in Every Way My husband and I spent 3 nights in this excellent and charming hotel during the first part of November and were delighted with our experience there. Selene, the extremely professional representative who assisted me with my reservation, couldn't have been more helpful. I told her it was a special occasion (my birthday) and she offered us a luxurious, corner location, two room suite, complete with two bathrooms, perfect view of the space needle, and even the deep red decor I was hoping for. Every single employee we encountered focused on making our stay as special as possible, beginning with the cheerful, very knowledgeable Bridgitte who greeted us at the front desk and went out of her way to ensure we had every detail we might need to add to our comfort.This hotel also has an excellent restaurant, Andaluca, where we ate breakfast in the mornings. Afternoon rest stops were spent in Oliver's, a very cozy, intimate bar filled with light from an enormous wall of windows overlooking the Seattle street scene and offering superb drinks and delicious menu items.The Mayflower Park is also located just four blocks from Pike Place Market, which enabled us to walk to every location we wanted to visit while in town, from restaurants to shopping to the theatre. It's also connected to the monorail, which makes it effortless to whiz to the Space Needle for dinner. For those of you looking for a beautifully furnished, timeless and intimate boutique hotel located in the heart of downtown and providing superb service, food and ambience, I can't say enough about selecting the Mayflower Park for your next visit to Seattle.",5
865,865,"Nice room in Downtown Seattle A business trip to Seattle brought me to the Mayflower Park hotel for two nights. Although I had lived in Seattle for much of my life, I'd never noticed the place or (amazingly enough) been to Andaluca or the hotel bar.Overall, this was a fine place to stay; it's a solid downtown hotel.LOCATIONThe hotel is centrally located, at 4th and Olive. Although I didn't do much sightseeing, it's walking distance from a number of Seattle attractions. Close to the Market, close to the Waterfront, close to Westlake... you get the idea.Mind you, central location does have its occasional downside as well. There's a lot of traffic on the surrounding streets, and I did notice a little traffic noise in my room. It didn't bother me, but if you're sensitive to that, you might want to look elsewhere.ROOMSI stayed in a Deluxe guestroom (a step up from the Classic), which had plenty of room and a nice configuration. There was a large bar area that had the coffee maker and a sink, which was nice to have. The workstation was large and functional, perfect if you need to work on the road. The bathroom was small an unspectacular, but nicely appointed and perfectly functional. I'm not a huge fan of Queen Anne Style (as the hotel describes their decor), but it seemed pretty understated and didn't bother me.There was no noise from other rooms or the hallway, but there was some early-morning street noise. Know your tolerance for traffic noise and plan accordingly.FACILITIES/LOBBYThe lobby is small, but nicely appointed. Not much to say about it.Oliver's, the bar, is a good place to have a drink, and always looked inviting when I returned to the hotel. Bar help was friendly and they have Pike Place Ale on tap, always a plus for me. Aside from WiFi, I didn't use the business facilities, so I'm not sure what they're like. There's also a workout room, which I never found time to use.RESTAURANTI ate at the very chic-looking Andaluca the first night I was there and was very pleased. I sat at the small bar in the restaurant and got great service. If you like shellfish, don't miss the baked mussels; they were stunningly good, and went really well with a glass of Spanish bubbly. I wanted to go back the second night but had already made other dinner plans. I'll go back when I get the chance.STAFFHotel staff was helpful and tolerant of my questions and occasional mishaps (like losing my room key). I'd describe the help as professional if slightly aloof in some instances -- not a problem for me, but don't expect to be overwhelmed by warmth.Bar and restaurant staff were professional, attentive, and friendly.SUMMARYIf you're looking for a decent hotel in a great downtown location, this should fit the bill. The restaurant and bar are the strong points, although everything was certainly better-than-acceptable. For a two-night business trip, the location and amenities were just what I needed, and the stay was uneventful. I'd rate it at the lower end of above average",4
866,866,Excellent Downtown hotel       hotel exterior,5
867,867,"Great Hotel and Staff This hotel was great. Very clean and perfect location.We had wonderful service dealing with everyone employed by the hotel and even were upgraded to a suite without asking for that. Britney at the front desk was completely amazing and certainly knows what customer service means. They are very lucky to have her.This is an old gem that has been kept up to standards that travelers should expect. Hope you choose to stay here, I am pretty picky so this was a very pleasant surprise.",5
868,868,"So-So in Seattle We stayed 2 nights here based on reviews on tripadvisor. First of all, this hotel is in an excellent location. For families, it's close to the pike's place market. For hipsters, it's close to Belltown. It's located on the same block as a popular mall and corporate shopping. For those who plan to hit center city, the monorail is conveniently right next door. All staff was helpful, polite, and professional. We were able to check in early with no problems. The bellmen were helpful with city tips and the front desk was always pleasant. Our room was a bit cramped, but the bed was comfortable and the room was very clean and tidy.",4
869,869,"Excellent Choice for Seattle Visit! My husband and I decided to take a long weekend in Seattle. Having never been there, I read a lot of reviews on Tripadvisor and selected the Mayflower Park Hotel for our stay at the recommendations of many. It was great! Our flights came in very early and left really late, but they were able to accommodate an early check in and a late check out with no problems. I had booked their Rise and Shine package, so we had a delicious breakfast sent up to our room every morning. And it's true what others say---Olivers is great! We enjoyed their cocktails (especially the infused Bloody Mary) each night before having dinner in town. The front desk staff and concierge was very helpful and polite. We got a room on the 12th floor in the corner, so we had great views. Although the room was smaller than an average sized hotel room, it suit our needs perfectly. Also, at the suggestion of others on tripadvisor we took the Downtown Airporter through Grayline for $18 each, roundtrip. It picked up/dropped off at the Westin less than 2 minutes away from the Mayflower Park. This was a super easy alternative to taking a cab from the airport/downtown. We had considered renting a car, but glad we didn't in the end. Everything was easy to get to without a car. Location wise the hotel was perfect for our needs. We walked to the Pikes Place Market everyday. Also, having the monorail and Westlake Center (food court/shopping) attached to the hotel made travel to Seattle Center easy. We celebrated one night with dinner at the Space Needle restaurant. It is overpriced as other say, but it was worth the experience and views. Plus you have to consider the $16 per person you'd spend just to go up it, so it worked out! We also went on the Savory Seattle Food tour through The Pikes Place Market and it was great! Well worth the time and money. Overall, we had a great trip to Seattle and the Mayflower Park Hotel is probably the biggest reason why! Thanks to everyone on Tripadvisor for your suggestions!",4
870,870,"Excellent Service, Very Good Facility We booked a delux room for a long weekend getaway in April 2008 but arrived too early in the morning, so they smiled and gave us a corner suite instead! Well furnished, two small rooms, but certainly enough space. The hotel is a heritage building perfectly located between Macy's and Nordstrom's, right next to the monorail, a few blocks from the major theatres and a short walk to Pike Place Market. We only had breakfast in their restaurant, but it was very good. Highly recommended.",5
871,871,"Good value for money We stayed here for two nights and found it to be a great little hotel with a convenient downtown location, helpful staff and comfortable lobby. The only downside was that the room was on the small side and the bathroom was a bit dated and not as clean as we would have liked. We had to catch a late afternoon plane and the staff kindly let us stay two hours past checkout time, after which they stored our bags downstairs while we went off for a late lunch/early dinner. When we returned the taxi was waiting and our bags were already loaded inside. Now that's what I call efficiency!",4
872,872,Excellent hotel in Seattle! Convenient! Comfortable! And reasonably priced! A great comfortable and still value for money hotel.,4
873,873,"Good place to stay downtown The Mayflower Park was perfectly fine for our recent trip to the Seattle. The room was small but very clean and the staff were quite friendly and eager to please. Best of all, the hotel is within walking distance of any place we cared to reach downtown. Further, it a great value compared with other downtown hotels we considered. While the hotel experience itself was forgettable, we didn't go to Seattle to hang out in our room, so would definitely stay there again should we return.",4
874,874,"Good Choice - visit Seattle without rental car This is a well managed historic hotel in a good downtown location, convenient to mass transportation, with lots of restaurants and shopping nearby, a Great location to use as a base to explore Seattle. We stayed at the Mayflower Park for two nights at the beginning of a 10 day trip to the Puget Sound area and returned for the last two nights. Our first room was a very nice large deluxe room on an upper floor with a king bed and sitting area with sofa, two chairs and coffee table. We slept with the window open a couple of inches and were not bothered by street sounds. Rooms in Seattle were scarce at the end of our trip, so we emailed the hotel after getting the first reservation and were able to get a smaller room, about the size of a standard Marriott room, with two queen beds and two bathrooms on a lower floor at the same price. Both were very nice rooms, great for sleeping with good maid service, but being an historic building, the bathrooms were smaller than bathrooms found in newer properties. The front desk staff provided good recommendations for dining and were extremely pleasant. On the evening of our arrival we had a light meal and drinks in Oliver鈥檚, the hotel lounge. The food and service was good. Preferring a light breakfast, we used coffee shops and cafes out of the hotel. We opted to pick up our rental car at a downtown location at the end of our 1st two nights, preferring to explore large cities on foot and eliminated both the valet parking and airport rental car concession fees. Gray Line Downtown Airporter bus service ($18pp roundtrip) from SeaTac to the nearby Weston Hotel worked well and we walked the two blocks to the Mayflower Park. Being at the end of the Monorail to Seattle Center was a plus and we also took advantage of the free daytime downtown public bus, using the nearby underground bus tunnel. There are many things to see and do in Seattle. This hotel worked well for us and we would definitely use it again.",5
875,875,"Great location The Mayflower Park had attentive service and a great location. It was an easy walk to Pike's Place Market and attached to the Westlake Mall where you can access the monorail. We opted for the deluxe room to gain a little more area and were glad we did. We had a corner room with 3 windows on 2 walls and we had lots of light. As high as we were, it was surprising to still be able to hear the traffic so well. I guess we were tired enough at night that it did not really turn into an issue. The bathroom is very small with a pedestal sink. A small glass shelf above the sink is where I removed my contacs and I really prefer a vanity area. I estimated about 20 inches at the most between the sink and tub. The bathroom was definitely my least favorite thing about the room. The elevators were unbelievably slow and we spent a lot of time during our several day stay waiting on them. I think this might be a better one night stay place with a good rate from a Priceline type internet booking.",4
876,876,Loved the Mayflower!       Our Room,4
877,877,"Great accommodations We stayed at The Mayflower Hotel on Saturday, September 13th, the night before we left for our Alaskan cruise. The rooms are not large, but we were extremely happy with the room. The decor was very classic and the beds super comfortable. I would highly recommend this hotel. It's just a short couple blocks to the Market which we visited in the afternoon. The monorail to the Space Needle is attached to the hotel which is extremely convenient. That evening we walked back down to the Market area for dinner and again in the morning before our flight for breakfast.",5
878,878,"great location downtown I am currently staying at the Mayflower Park Hotel. My husband, son and I stayed here the first night after arriving in Seattle. We have returned to stay two nights more at the end of our travels, before flying out of Sea-Tac airport. Contact the hotel directly for a rate, as we got a cheaper one going through them directly rather than online... (AAA discount)The Mayflower is a nice, older, hotel right in the heart of downtown Seattle. I have to add that there are many hotels near this location most very expensive, and just 6 blocks away are a few that are cheaper...anything cheaper than the Mayflower will land you in a much less desirable location. The Mayflower is a very old building that has been renovated in the 90's, yet is is still very clean, the decor is like saying at a fancy mother in laws house....The single bedroom is very small but for a night it is fine, the three of us barely fit with luggage and a portacrib..This second time we are in a delux queen room (they upgraded us for free) it is a great size for the three of us. The bathrooms in both of our rooms have been very nice, clean, tiny, but tastefully done. The front desk is really warm and friendly, and the restaurant and bar on site are great too. Hope you enjoy it.",4

880,880,"Best hotel in downtown Seattle This is the best location in downtown Seattle. It is also the best priced hotel for this class of hotel in downtown. I use to live in Seattle and always walked by this hotel and would look in through the large window where the bar is located and would always want to go inside. It has a warm and inviting look to it and I was not one bit disspointed. First of all, the staff is excellent. From the valet that greets you when you drive up, to the front desk personnel, and the personnel that maintains the rooms, everyone is superb. The room was very nice with great beds and wonderful bed linens. The bathroom is a bit small but this is the price you pay for staying in an older hotel in the heart of downtown. The small bathroom was a small sacrifice considering the hotel has rooms with two queen size beds and is located on the same block as Westlake center and is only a few blocks to Pike Place Market. The rooms are also beautifully renovated and the property does not show its age.As I mentioned, you could not get a better location. It is located on the same block as Westlake Center. From here you can take the monorail to the Seattle Center. Nordstrom is only a block away and Pike Place is about three blocks away. I finally did go to the beautiful bar inside the hotel I use to look at years ago as I walked by and it was wonderful. They have some great drinks on the menu and you can order food here as well. We only had breakfast in the hotel's restaurant and it was excellent.",5

885,885,"As previously mentioned, GREAT LOCATION! We stayed at this hotel on the first night of our Seattle  Vancouver trip and was pleasantly surprised by it. The place is a European style hotel (in furnishings and size), but it was quite confortable and clean. It was also a good value overall compared to other hotels of this caliber--just be sure to check their website for special packages. Ours included the room, valet parking (which is normally a crazy $30/night--normal for downtown, though), and a $20 gas card for each night. The front desk person and manager didn't have my change to this certain package from just a room and were inflexible about giving it to me at first. That was pretty disappointing, but we got a call a couple of hours later stating that they would give us it afterall.The location was superb--VERY close to delicious Dahlia Lounge(for dinner) and Lola (for breakfast--have the Greek scramble). It is just a few blocks from Pike Place Market and it sounded like an attached monorail ride to the Seattle Center.",4
886,886,"Great Location We stayed at the Mayflower pre cruise. I picked it based on reviews I read here and the location of the hotel. I was very pleased with my choice. The location was fabulous. Since it's connected to the monorail station it was very easy to get to the Space Needle and back, then we walked every where else. We were only 3 to 4 blocks from Pikes Market a very easy walk there and back. The staff there could have not been more helpful or eager to help. They were on the spot to get our luggage to the rooms and were very friendly. I will add the bellman staff were some of the most handsome I'd ever seen. I plan to go back to Seattle and would definitely stay there again. The beds were super comfortable and the rooms were very spacious. A great value in my opinion!",5
887,887,"Beautiful Restored Hotel We really enjoyed the Mayflower Park Hotel. From our check-in to our check-out the staff was outstanding the Hotel beautifully maintained. Our original room had only one hight stand and reading light and we asked for a different room. Robert the desk clerk ,was very acomodating and cheked around until he found a room that would work. The Hotel is a Historic Hotel of America and is truly a gem. The location is fantastic. It is connected to a shopping center, however, the entrance is so hidden that yo would not know it was there. The monorail station is in the center so it is very convenient to get to the Space Needle. You can walk to restaurants and shopping.We actually stayed here 2 times on our trip. One night on our way to the Jan Juans, and 2 nights after we returned. We had 2 different rooms and both were beautifully appointed with all the amenities.The staff is very friendly and helpful. We truly enjoyed our stay at the Mayflower Park Hotel.",5
888,888,"Can't Beat It The Mayflower Park is an excellent choice for price, location, friendly knowledgeable staff etc. My wife and I stayed in their classic room ( Room 1106) this is a corner room looking out 4th and mall area. If someone travels with a lot of baggage, then I would suggest a larger room. Otherwise the room was clean and sufficient for two people. We visited a couple larger hotels, but found them not as relaxing and people everywhere. It was like being out in the streets in their lobby's. Bottom line folks...we would happily make another reservation at the Mayflower Park!",5
889,889,Nice Hotel Good location. Across the street from Macy's. Room was a little small. Beds were fine. Parking was included in the room price as a promotional period. Staff was friendly and helpful with directions.,5
890,890,"Great location and service We had not been to Seattle in a few years and we wanted to find an nice hotel in downtown that was reasonably priced. The Mayflower Park met all these criteria. So we took Amtrak from Portland to Seattle (a great ride in both directions) and checked in at the Mayflower.When we checked in, the front desk got us a very quiet room that actually had two separate bathrooms (it was nice to be able to spread out). The service was excellent throughout and we got some good tips from the concierge on what to do and where to eat.The location was excellent, a few blocks away from the Pike Street Market and right at the termini of both the monorail and the new streetcar to Lake Union. In addition, downtown buses are free so we only needed a taxi once (after a tiring day and evening on the waterfront).",5
891,891,Very Satisfied       View from the window next to our bed,5
892,892,"Great Location Got a room via HOTWIRE for the 1st week in July 08. I鈥檓 not sure what sort of room they would call it, but it was probably the standard accommodation for 2 people. It was small yet efficient. Perfect for a one-night stay, but probably better to opt for a bigger room if staying longer. Also, the d茅cor is traditional 鈥?not the usual modern or contemporary that I鈥檇 prefer. The bathroom was tiny but the water pressure okay. The location was ideal. Walking distance to several of the downtown attractions. Concierge, check-in/out and bellhop service was efficient and professional. Although I don鈥檛 have any complaints about this hotel, I鈥檇 probably opt to stay elsewhere only because the d茅cor of the room did not suit me.",3
893,893,"Top Class Excellent, we extended our stay. Central and top class, couldn't fault it.",5
894,894,"Stop in before  I stayed in this hotel while on a cruise and I liked it. They have a good restaurant, I got a nice room, and it's close to a mall and the monorail. Very nice and lovely hotel.",5
895,895,"Responsive Staff impresses! Our party of 5 stayed here in two rooms for one night after disembarking from our cruise. I called from the pier at 8am to see if we could check our luggage in the lobby while we wandered around Seattle's downtown since I knew we could not check into our room until 3 or 4pm. Much to my surprise, they told me one of our rooms was available so they were happy to check us in. We arrived by taxi at 9am and checked into that room. The other room was ready by Noon, and they contacted me by cell phone to let me know we were free to pick up our other room card when we were ready.One person in our party is recovering from knee surgery, and was limping quite pronouncedly after overdoing it on an excursion the day before. The hotel staff made known to me that they do have a wheelchair on the property and said they would be happy to get it out of storage if we could use it. I thought that was a great idea, but my relative said no and opted to walk a little bit and then rest in the room while the rest of us adventured. Pike's Place Market was an easy 3 blocks away, and the monorail stop is just a block away. The 2nd floor of the hotel links to the Westlake Center Mall which we enjoyed, and there is lots of shopping available around this hotel's location.We had one room with 1 queen bed, and another room with 2 queen beds. Both were clean, with comfortable beds. The 2-queen room had a flat screen TV while the 1-queen room had a normal model. Both had desks with chairs, cozy sitting chairs, and free wireless connection. The shower/bath was great with plenty of hot water and terrific pressure. The decor is very charming, and it was quiet--we never heard any noise from neighbors or otherwise. One of us ate in Andaluca for breakfast (opens at 6:30am) and it was nice but pricey ($11-16). The rest opted for Starbuck's which is only a half block down 4th Ave. For lunch, we loved P.F. Chang's which was just around the corner. We enjoyed our stay very much, and would like to return when we have more time to spend in Seattle. All the staff, from the desk attendants to the bellmen to the concierge, were very warm and responsive to our questions and needs. Wonderful experience!",5
896,896,"Great place to stay Great place to stay in Seattle - easy walk to anywhere downtown, especially Pike Market. Lots of shops and places to eat close by. We had a nice double room with queen beds - excellent choice. Large mall close by and monorail to Space Needle is a few blocks away. Highly recommmend!",4
897,897,"Ideal location, good value We stayed for four nights at the Mayflower for a short vacation, and the location was ideal. Easy walking distance to Pike Market, Belltown and only about a 10-minute walk to Capitol Hill. Rooms are pretty basic, but we booked a good rate (average of $209/night) from Friday night to Tuesday. Never ate at the restaurant but the hotel does a have a limited 24-hour room service menu.Ultimately, great location for a very walkable city.",4
898,898,"Charming! Stayed here for a work meeting. Although the rooms are not large, they are very well maintained and comfortable. Fabulous beds with great linens. Close to Pike's Market, great restaurants and shopping. Can't forget to mention the hotel bar, Oliver's. Great ambiance and great drinks including their signature drink - the Paradigm Shift. A quality boutique hotel!",5

900,900,Perfect Location - Great Staff - Wonderful Quiet Room       Pike Place Market,5
901,901,"Great hotel, terrific location The Mayflower Hotel is a lovely property in a great location in downtown Seattle. The service was great, especially at the concierge desk, which was extremely helpful. I was especially impressed with the subtle but appropriate concern for security that I noted at the front desk. The only small problem we encountered once or twice was in getting a taxi, which the doorman has to hail because there is no space on the street for taxis to wait in. There are LOTS of great restaurants, shopping, and even movies within walking distance, and the monorail station is just a block away. For relaxation, the chocolate martinis in the lobby bar (Oliver's) come highly recommended! The building is old, built in 1927, and truly has classical elegance and lots of personality. The rooms are lovely, but the bathrooms are old style, with only a minimum of shelf space for cosmetics and toiletries.",4
902,902,"What a Gem! Just returned from our second delightful stay this year at the Mayflower Park. We had a 5th floor suite -- lovely sitting room with separate bedroom. My husband normally rises earlier than I so this is a perfect arrangement for us. A wet sink bar with coffee maker in the sitting room allows him to sit at the desk to write while he enjoys morning coffee. Comfy sofa, armchair with ottoman and cocktail table and windows on two sides make this room a pleasant place to hang out. We enjoyed a terrific lunch and breakfast the next day in Andaluca and had a nightcap in Oliver's after the baseball game. Both rooms are attractive and friendly environments. This hotel is a real winner and we feel totally at home staying there. We'll be back...",5
903,903,"Excellent Choice We stayed one night before an Alaskan cruise. The location could not have been better. We could easily walk, shop, and sightsee. We probably had the most fun that evening in the bar, Olivers. We talked to locals and enjoyed the people watching-sit at the bar to enjoy the views. The bartenders were nice and the drinks were good. Our room was a good size with a small but very clean recently remodeled bathroom. I would stay here again when I return to the city.",5
904,904,"DO NOT have your WEDDING here!!! The wedding party booked out the hotel. Friday friends met up at the lounge, Oliver's, we were at least 50 people. I think the bartender was a little overwhelmed. 50 people in a 175 capacity room would seem normal, but apparently not.Wedding day, Saturday: the brides family chartered a boat that took us out to Kiana Lodge for the ceremony. The weather wast perfect! We docked back into Seattle around 11:30 and The plan was to return to Oliver's.I think they decided that they had enough of the wedding party as they refused to serve any of the 30-40 people that showed up. They continued to serve other individuals that were not apart of the wedding party. A lot of money was spent at the hotel and selectively the decided not to serve anyone our entire group.Enjoy your stay!!!",2
905,905,Always Enjoy the MayFlower This nice hotel has that old world charm and is always clean. Great location - you can walk to most of the shops and many great restaurants. The only tricky part is accessing the hotel with Seattle's many one-way streets. Very good value. Have stayed three times and would stay again.,4
906,906,"Terrific European-style hotel with a fabulous location We recently stayed at the Mayflower Park Hotel for 2 nights in Seattle. We booked this hotel as part of a package (along with other great hotels in Victoria and Vancouver, BC Canada) via Clipper Vacations. The Mayflower Park has a European Old World feel to it with lots of character you don't normally find at the big national chains. We booked a king-size bedded room via Clipper Vacations and received a fabulous 1-bedroom and living room king corner suite. The room was large. The bathroom had been renovated and was very clean, but also quite small, yet functional. The bar off the lobby seemed to be a very popular place with Seattle locals. The location couldn't be beat -- we walked everywhere from this hotel -- just ten minutes walk from the waterfront and Pike Place Market (have breakfast there at Lowell's). The hotel is located immediately adjacent to Westlake Center shopping mall from where we boarded the monorail to the Space Needle at Seattle Center. And underneath Westlake Center you'll find the impressive (and FREE) downtown transit tunnel where you can take a convenient bus to the Pioneer Square district or anywhere else in Seattle for that matter. Should we return to Seattle, we'd definitely stay again at the Mayflower Park.",5
907,907,"Great location and restaurants I stayed at the Mayflower Park the last weekend in April. For a tourist, it was located in a great location. Quick 4 block walk to Pike Place Market, and the monorail to the Space Needle is connected to the hotel.I had 1/2 price appetizers and sangria in the Andaluca restaurant just off the lobby on Friday afternoon. This is a tiny restaurant and bar, but everything was delicious and the staff was very friendly. I also tried the world famous martinis at Oliver's Bar which is also in the lobby and they were great. It was very quiet on a Sunday night, but a very nice place to relax and enjoy a cocktail.The room I had was tiny. And the bathroom was even smaller. Because it was just me, it was fine, but if there were 2 people it would be claustrophic. I was lucky enough to be given a room on the top floor...it was very quiet. However- waiting on the elevator did require some patience. All in all, it was a quaint little hotel and I would recommend it.",4
908,908,"So Glad We Stayed at the Mayflower Park Hotel I know it's been nearly a year since we stayed there, but the visit has stayed with me. We had less than a day to stay in Seattle (we actually only flew there as a cheap gateway from NY to Vancouver Island and Vancouver), but the hotel made Seattle feel more like a destination than a stopover. The hotel was absolutely perfect for us! From the moment we pulled up, the staff was extremely friendly. They made our three kids feel right at home with great goodie bags (thoughtful items in an insulated bag that my daughter still uses as her lunchbag) and great attitudes. The room was very spacious (it was basically a suite but I think was considered a regular room), clean, and there was a great view of the Space Needle. The room felt nicely updated, with two flat screened tv's and pleasant decour. We were a nice walk away from Pike Place Market. I don't remember what we paid for the room, but we got what felt like a very high class boutique hotel for the same price as the lower level, generic hotels in the area. I felt for the duration of my stay like we were getting away with something.We can't wait to go back to the Mayflower Park Hotel and experience Seattle in depth!",5
909,909,Great Staff Great Location = Great Stay I've stayed here MANY times. It is my first choice for downtown Seattle hotels1 block from Westlake Center and roughly 4 blocks from Pike Place Market this hotel has a great location. But what puts this place above most is the private owners who are good to their staff. Ask an employee how long they have worked there and their answer is usually 15 years or more. That makes for people who care. With low rates for a downtown hotel ($170ish) this place is a winner!,5
910,910,"Excellent stay, great location I chose this hotel based on other Tripadvisor's comments, and I was more than pleased with my stay.The hotel is absolutely charming, along with being clean and well-kept. Front desk staff and doormen were very polite and helpful, and on check-in, the receptionist took the time to show me a map of Seattle along with an explanation of the best places to go and how to get there.Location is unbeatable - walking distance to Pike's market, $2 monorail ride to Space Needle and amusement park, across the street from very large Macy's, and around the corner from Nordstrom's and a pleasant shopping plaza with everything you could want.This hotel is an excellent value, and I'd return here in a heartbeat.",5
911,911,"Great Hotel, Great Location Fantastic location, great hotel. Restaurant, Andaluca, was excellent. Highly reccomended for both business and pleasure travel.",5
912,912,"Flower Power We stayed here as part of a Clipper Vacation package from Victoria. This wasn鈥檛 the 1st time we had stayed at the hotel but was a good reminder of why we came back.The service was helpful without being overbearing, the rooms were well presented with a very comfortable bed (a bed is a bed to me so the fact I commented on this is a surprise) and wonderful shower. We ordered room service for dinner and breakfast and were pleasantly surprised on both counts with the speed, quality and again friendliness of staff.One of the biggest perks of the hotel is the location, you couldn鈥檛 be closer to the shops or the monorail, which takes you out to the sites.We requested a late checkout and were accommodated without fuss, which made our long haul flight a little more manageable.Would I stay again? In a heartbeat.",4
913,913,"Great hotel, great location Recently spent 5 nights at the Mayflower while attending a conference in Seattle. The location is fantastic as noted by other reviewers. You are walking distance to everywhere. My stay was very nice. My room was quite comfortable. I was very impressed with the quality sheets, pillows, mattress, towels and bathrobes. The only caveats would be the fitness center. I travel alot and rely on hotel fitness centers. This one had only a few pieces of equipment. The other would be the wireless in the room, although complimentary, it was excrutiating slow. This would not stop me from staying here again but I mention in case these are important factors for you.",5
914,914,"Lovely Hotel, Perfect Location I chose the Mayflower Park for a quick business trip after my partner had a good experience a few months ago, and could only agree. This fine 1920s building has been handsomely restored, and my 12th floor room was immaculate and well-appointed, if perhaps a bit on the small side. Nice extras included an unusually large walk-in closet with two robes and in-room coffee from the excellent local Torrefazione Italia brand (not the usual in-room commercial brew). The housekeeping staff was unobtrusive, friendly and competent. I don't usually compliment hotels on their valet service, but in this case it proved another distinct plus, especially since parking (normally $25 overnight) had been included in my package rate (check for specials if booking through the hotel website). The valets were extremely quick to bring the car around when I called from my room, alert to pick up the keys whenever I returned to the hotel, and volunteered to give directions. As others have pointed out, the desk is sometimes very friendly and sometimes more or less indifferent, but I found it generally well-run. And it's worth nothing that the Mayflower Park is in an excellent location--within walking distance of all downtown shopping, Pike Place Market, the must-see new public library, and other major attractions; city buses are free of charge downtown and a car isn't urgently needed, and if you're driving to the University or points farther afield the location is also very convenient, notwithstanding Seattle's famously awful traffic. In all, a very handsome and well-run establishment, old-fashioned in a good way and very low-key.",4
915,915,Best bar in the lobby I meet a friend here every year. Pop down the elevator and you're at Oliver's -- a great place for a few drinks while people watching. Great location.,5
916,916,"Not as good as it used to be. Perfect location. Gorgeous looking hotel. Rooms are tiny tiny tiny. Bathroom has no bath just a shower. The service has really slipped here, but it is still an okay place to stay. Do not expect to have doors opened for you and to be treated like you are at the Ritz-Carlton. Also, I disagree with some of the other writers, I could hear my neighbors through the walls. I would recommend staying for one night, but a 4-5 night stay in the claustrophobic room is maddening. The restaurant attached to the hotel, Andaluca, is one of Seattle's finest. The service at the bar Oliver's is not great, but it has wonderful old world ambiance which makes it feel authentic and fun.",2
917,917,"Very nice city hotel The Mayflower was a very pretty historic hotel located in a good area of town that was convenient to the public market, lots of great restaurants, shopping, and nightlife. The staff were very friendly and accomodating and our room was large and well-maintained with a very comfortable bed. My only complaint is that the bathroom was pretty tiny but it really wasn't much of an issue for just two people. The hotel lounge had very good martinis but be sure and stay away from the desserts! Ours was eight dollars for the worst bread pudding by a pastry chef I've ever had. The only down side to the hotel was that it was a little pricey and the valet parking is VERY expensive. However, that will be the situation with any hotel in downtown Seattle. Overall, the hotel was great and we will definitely stay there again when we return.",4
918,918,"Fabulous stay Mayflower Hotel was excellent. The location is absolutely perfect - a nice stroll to the Pike Street Market, with some awesome shopping close by - Macy's, Nordstrom, AF, J. Crew, etc. just a block away. The hotel was clean and comfortable with good beds, and the lounge made a wicked GT! I was particularly impressed with the help we received from the concierge - he came up with a couple of great restaurant suggestions and was very helpful to newcomers to the city.The bathrooms are, indeed, small. Not much room to put a toiletry bag. Our room was on the 10th floor and it was very spacious - two queen beds and lots of room to move around.I'd stay there again without question - the location and comfort of the hotel were exceptional.",5

920,920,"Mayflower Park Wonderful Wow! What a wonderful hotel - such a shame we could only stay one night.Location - Convenient to just about everything Seattle has to offer.Rooms - Beautiful! Clean! Just like the photos.Staff - Wonderful! Helpful! Funny! The Concierge was a riot who was also very, very helpful in booking things.Room Service - for tired travellers it was quick and delicious.Would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in Seattle, it was a pleasure and when we can return again this is where we'll stay.",5
921,921,"One of the best! This hotel was one of the best I've stayed at. This boutique-style hotel provided impeccable attention to detail. From the front-desk staff, to the valet parking staff, to the concierge services, to the housekeeping staff--everything was top-notch.If you're looking to be in the heart of Seattle, this location can't be beat. The hotel is directly across the street from Macys and is connected to the Westlake Center on the Mezzanine level. We were only four blocks from Pikes Market and were within walking distance to the Space Needle and the big REI store.We booked a Corporate Comforts package, which rolled the parking right into our nightly rate. Our first night was $199, and the subsequent nights at $181 (plus taxes)--so it was an amazing value for the location.We had a corner guestroom, which was actually two separate rooms. The main room had a large sofa, chair, ottoman, table large television/armoire, wet bar with mini-sink, mini-frig, and work desk. Complimentary high-speed internet was provided for our laptop. We needed a roll-away brought in for our daughter for a couple of nights, and there was plenty of space for that in the front room. The roll-way was not your typical folded-up bed, but a thick twin-size mattress on a platform. One large window in each room faced west, plus one additional large window in the main room faced north.There was a glass-paneled door connecting the two rooms. The bedroom had a king-size bed with a heavy comforter and a down-filled blanket. Six Pacific Coast down pillows were on the bed. Also in this room were a wooden valet, large dresser, two nightstands, and a high-definition television. The bathroom was located off the bedroom. Although not overly large, it was well appointed with very nice toiletries. A hair dryer, iron and ironing board were located in the closet, as were two robes.Considering we were in the heart of downtown, we really didn't hear much noise at night--other than an occasional siren. The rooms are very well sound-proofed, and we didn't hear anyone next to us or on the floor above. The nightly turn-down service was a nice surprise. There were individual heating/cooling controls in each of the rooms, which allowed us to adjust each room independently.We didn't eat in the hotel's restaurant, so we can't comment on that. There are many dining places closeby, including several Starbucks, many take-out places in the Westlake Center, and a Cheesecake Factory a few blocks away.This hotel would not be particularly attractive for families with young children--especially if you need a pool or game area. It would be a great match for most other travelers if you're looking for a unique hotel with great service. We would absolutely stay at this hotel if we're ever in Seattle again and highly recommend it.",5
922,922,"Reservation Mgr (Craig) solved problem This hotel is in a great location...The staff all did a great job with wonderful attitudges. However, Craig (the rsv mgr) resolved anissue we had with our booking and we left with a very pleasantexperience. This is an old hotel, though impeccable, therefore the rooms are small. The most difficult is in the bathroom withvery little shelving to put personal items.",5
923,923,"Good Price, Great location The Mayflower Park is within walking distance to Pike Place Market (don't go there on a week-end if you can help it) and all the shoping you could ever desire. Really nice stores. It it also next to the monorail stop and convenient to the new sculpture park at the waterfront.It is clean and comfortable and a real treat from the chains. Service was good. Parking was about 19-$20/day, I think. The restaurant is well regarded by our local friends although we did not eat there on this trip.Thisd is a nice place downtown that I'd stay in again. Veryy convenient to Seattle University.",4
924,924,"overall pleased My husband and I stayed for 1 night. We had never been to downtown Seattle before and chose this one from trip advisor.We were pleased. Tiny bathroom but it is one of the first hotels in Seattle and way back when the bathrooms were small. Our room # 704 was very quite did not hear a peep and I am a very light sleeper. Our mattress was lumpy, they need a new one for that room. I thought they were a bit cheap about the water bottles..... Beware! There is a tag on them saying 4.00 but I was so thristy when I came in I just grabbed it and drank then my husband said that will be 4.00 dollars honey! Dinner was very good @ the hotel restaurant and breakfast was fair to good....yucky coffee. I would recommend this hotel as long as your stanards are not 4****. Enjoy!",4
925,925,"Great location, nice hotel! Our family of six stayed at this hotel in two rooms. We had one room with two queen beds and two bathrooms. The room was well-decorated and the beds were comfortable. We had a great view of the Space Needle and the Sound. The other room had two queen beds and a sofa bed. It was an interesting set up--not quite a suite but the living area was separated from the beds by a wall. The hotel is convenient to downtown shopping. It is between Macy's and Nordstrom. It is attached to Westlake Center so you can shop and eat at nice restaurants or even a food court. I like historic hotels and enjoy seeing them well-maintained. The bathrooms weren't gigantic but had everything you would need. This is the part of town that I spend the most time in. It's safe and there's a lot going on. You can take the Monorail from Westlake Center to Seattle Center and it's a short walk to Pike Place Market. Although I am local, my family and I stayed downtown to celebrate the Market's 100th anniversary and were quite pleased with our visit. If I go to a play or want to stay downtown for a Christmas shopping outing I'll choose this hotel again.",4

927,927,"Amazing Highly recommend the Mayflower Park. Stayed in a queen delux room two nights, (August 3rd and 4th) on the 10th floor. Beds are great, room very large. Could not hear people in the hallway or other rooms at all. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. The bar is very cosy - and great food. I cannot say anything bad about this hotel. It was everything and more than I expected. I'll certainly be back.",5
928,928,"Loved the Mayflower Park Hotel! We stayed at the Mayflower Park Hotel in late April 2007. We used to live in the area, so knew the location was prime. The hotel has a great reputation, so we decided to book our stay here and see for ourselves. We were not disappointed!We had a room on the 3rd floor. Our room was quite large, and very comfortable. As we walked in the door, there was a large wet bar with a small refrigerator. Upon entering the main part of the room, there was a sofa and several chairs with ottomans as well as a large coffee table. A very useable seating area, which is not always the case in hotels. We had a king bed, and near the bed area was the large walk in closet (with bathrobes for our use) and the bathroom. The bathroom was a tad small, but not cramped. Everything was nicely appointed and extremely well maintained. Our room looked out to the street towards the old Bon store (now Macy's), so at the holidays it would be a very nice view.Our room was very quiet. We never heard noise from other rooms or from the street. We did not have any meals at the hotel restaurant, but we did have drinks in the bar, Oliver's, several times. This place gets busy, so the wait for drinks can be a bit, but it was never very long.We used the valet several times and they were always very quick. Our visit was so enjoyable that while we were checking out, I booked another stay there for this fall for a girls week in the area. The room was beautiful and the location cannot be beat.",5
929,929,"Rip-off. Outdated, Noisy, Rude Staff, Overpriced Well, the lobby is nice!! That's about all I can say that's positive. Our room was tiny and extremely noisy. We could hear every word in the conversation next door. Our bathroom was outdated, no room for our toiletries or anything else. So was the elevator... very slow and guests had to share the elevator with waiters, cleaning staff and maintenance staff carrying all kinds of equipment, etc., etc. One computer for the whole hotel, and NO privacy when using computer, staff sits right behind you looking at your computer screen!! Hotel is also right next to a park filled with homeless people. What more can I say... we were disappointed to say the least, and I would skip this place at all cost if returning to Seattle.",1
930,930,"Great Location and Service I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel. But the place does have its pluses and minuses. Positives-1) Great service- as far as bellhops/valet, and housekeeping go. Getting the car was relatively quick, never a long wait (and supposedly the hotel was fully booked the time we were there) The room was always cleaned on a timely basis. One time we thought we lost our phone (after we had already come up the room) so the valet searched our car for us and even pulled our car up and helped us look for it again.2) Location-Short walk to Pike Place Market and connected to the Westlake Center (monorail/stores/food court)3) The king suite was spacious with a refrigerator and wet bar (convenient to bring back drinks since there is a Walgreens and Rite Aid about 2 blocks away), 2 tv's, and 2 thermostats (one for the bedroom and one for the sofa area)Negatives-1) Noise level-note from the other rooms but from the street below (Our room sat right at the corner of Olive and 4th) I don't know how it is from the higher floors (the hotel is only 12 stories tall) but being on the lower floors you will defintely hear road noise from buses and cars (worse if you open the window). If you are a light sleeper make sure you ask for a high room. The noise didn't bother me but I didn't need an alarm in the morning with all the buses passing by.2)No safe in the room-I though all hotels had one3)Only 2 elevators-Not really a big deal, but they are slow and the staff also use the same elevators so at times you will wait (but again not too bad unless you're impatient) and the elevator are on the small side4)Not stroller friendly-there are 2 entrances into the hotel one of which is a flight of like 10 steps (the main entrance)so you have to use the other entrance on the other side. And the connection to the Westlake Center is on the Mezzanine Level where you also have to go up about 15 stairs. (and again the elevator is small.5)Less chance of getting a good view-Remember there are only 12 floors and I think you have to be on the upper floors if you want to see the water or Space Needle. Compared to the Westin across the street which is super tall and I'm sure you have a better chance of getting a better view (I'm not too much into views so I was okay with looking at the street)Overall I was very pleased with the room and the hotel and wouldn't mind staying here again.",4
931,931,"Luxury I have the luxury of having stayed in a suite here on someone elses dime. The suite had a king size bed, a day bed and a dining table. It's posh, and to tell you the truth this is where I would stay if I was a movie or rock star.No complaints, doesn't get much better than this.",4
932,932,"Nice staff  My boyfriend  I only had one night to stay in Seattle on our vacation to the Pacific NW. At first I was crushed because I had my heart set on the Inn at the Market  they were full. I knew I wanted to stay close to the Pike Street Market  I booked the Mayflower Park unsure of its proximity. It turned out to be perfect- well located in the downtown area, it was just a couple minutes walk from the Fairmont, Triple Door, and the Market. Plus, if you like shopping, Macy's is just across the street. We checked in relatively early (around 10 am) and the kind clerk informed us that he did have *a* room available but it was on a low floor; however, if we didn't mind waiting, he could get us on the 12th floor (highest). IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT!! We had a perfect view of the Space Needle from our window! I booked a corner queen room because I read about the necessary extra room (only $7 extra with the AAA discount)- it was big enough for the two of us, esp just for one night. The bathroom wasn't much smaller than any other average hotel bathroom- a little aged, but fully functional. I liked the overall character of this historic hotel. Comfortable elegance :)",4
933,933,"Best Value in Seattle This is a centrally located hotel that is a very good value. I have stayed in a number of hotels downtown and this is my favorite for the price The rooms were clean and in good condition and the staff was very courteous. Unless, you want to pay more for a room closer to the water for the views this is the best place to stay downtown.",4
934,934,"Loved the two bathrooms! My sister and I spent one night in Seattle a few weeks ago at the Mayflower Park Hotel after an Alaskan cruise. I do a LOT of research before I book a hotel and I found that the Mayflower had some rooms with two queen beds and two baths. It could not have been more perfect for two women traveling together! Although they couldn't guarantee us that type of room, they did honor our request. We were across the street from Nordstoms and all the downtown shopping and just a few blocks from the Pike Place Market. I don't think we could have been in a better location. I thought the lobby was much nicer than in the hotel's pictures on the web sites and the bar off the lobby was beautiful, on the corner of the street with lots of paned windows and atmosphere. Great spot for a nightcap. Rooms were clean, beds comfortable, nice linens and toiletries; all in all we had a great experience. I had read that there was a lot of construction downtown, but we really didn't notice any. One last thing, there are buses on 1st street that are free and we caught a bus down to the old area of Seattle called Pioneer Square and took an underground tour in the afternoon. It was only a couple of hours but very interesting to learn about Seattle's history.",5
935,935,"Happily Surprised! This place was great! We thought because of the price, smaller size and age of the hotel we would have a slightly out of date historic hotel waiting for us - HOWEVER, when we walked in we where thrilled to find a beautifully updated hotel. The location is perfect for Pikes Market and other downtown shopping and dinning within walking distance. Our room was just right and very up to date and the bathroom spotless. The staff were extremely nice. From the doormen, valet, desk clerk to the concierge. Everyone was helpful and professional. The concierge reccommened excellent restaurants within walking distance and within minutes we had resservations and the local movie theater times printed and in our hands. We were impressed and will not only return to the Mayflower but will recommend it to friends. Lloved this hotel, staff, location and price. You won't be disappointed!",5
936,936,"Good location, lovely suite Booked a room for one night. We chose the Mayflower because it offers two QUEEN beds and I was traveling with my two sisters. The hotel upgraded us to a suite so one sister slept on the sofa bed. Unexpected, very nice. Great service, and beautiful room. Nice bath products, too! Room was very quiet. I'd certainly stay here again and recommend to others.",4
937,937,"Mayflower has some ""thorns"" Stayed at the Mayflower for a 2 day business meeting on June 5 and 6th. Advice to meeting planners: Think twice of having a meeting if over 70 participants will be at your function. The hotel was overwhelmed. Initially, the Plymouth Room, their largest conference room, which is under the lobby is attractive, but can only handle 8-9 tables of 8-10 people. Secondly, the mens room is up the stairs, across the lobby and down the stairs on the other side-- only the women's restaurant is adjacent to the meeting room. Finally, getting everyone's luggage out after the meeting was too much for 2 people. Chaos ensued for those running to catch a plane.As far rooms go, I was told I had an upgrade (Room 321). Apparently, I had a little more bathroom space. Unfortunately, the upgrade ended there, since I had a view of the hotel airconditioning unit, light well and having the hotel's mechanical power supply and hydraulic units kick on every few minutes did not allow a great night sleep. If you are given a room that looks into the lightwell, turn around and ask for a room that fronts the streets. You will be Sleepless in Seattle and highly disappointed if you dont.While most reviews, sound good for the most part, I want TripAdvisor members to be aware of some of the issues of this 80 year old hotel. Finally, make sure you allow for 15-20 minutes for valet. Your car could be blocks away. Oh, by the way, they charge $28.00 a day.",2
938,938,"Nice Hotel We were a group of six staying for two nights before our Alaskan cruise. Our room was spacious but the bathroom was tiny (typical for older hotels). The staff was very friendly and tried to be helpful but we were misinformed by the conceirge and bellman on more than one occassion. Our room was quiet but another couple traveling with us said their room was extremely noisy from the street traffic. We were on the same floor but around the corner from them.I didn't find the bed to be very comfortable as I've read in previous reviews. But I may be bias as I have a tempurpedic bed at home so it is difficult for me to find comfortable beds when traveling.The monorail station in the mall attached to the hotel is convenient but beware that it only travels to the space needle and back, there are no other stops.The restaurant attached to the hotel has great breakfast with excellent service.Seattle is a great city and I would love to travel there again. I might check out a different hotel just to have variety but I'd recommend this hotel to friends or family.",4
939,939,"Great Historic Hotel We were in town for a family wedding on Memorial Weekend. We had a wonderful time at this hotel. Two women traveling together could not ask for a better room. Our room had two beds and two bathrooms. The beds are so comfortable you could get spoiled. Great view from our 8th floor room. The room is not that large but for the amount of time we spent in the room it was perfect for us. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go downtown. Bring your walking shoes.We visited the space needle, pike's market, numerous restaurants, and did lots of shopping.Hotel staff is very friendly and helpful.Even if you don't have dinner in the hotel restaurant I would recommend dessert. We would stay here again.",5
940,940,"A wonderful hotel in a great location! If you are planning a weekend trip to Seattle, Mayflower Hotel is the place to stay. The location of this historic hotel can't be better. You will be within 5 to 10 walking minutes to everything you should see in Seattle. Places like, Seattle's famous Fresh Market with the most amazing fresh seafood, produce, beautiful flowers and fantastic restaurants; the Underground, Space Needle, Seattle's Waterfront views and you won't even need to exit to the street to take a ride on a Monorail because it is connected with the hotel building. Also this hotel has a complimentary valet parking which is a huge plus considering that all other hotels in the Downtown area charge $25-$30 per night. The rooms are clean and comfortable, a very nice staff. The hotel has a restaurant and a martini bar on the first floor for those who would like to relax after a long day of sightseeing. During your stay in Seattle I would recommend to take one of the Argosy Lock Cruises- it鈥檚 really fun and memorable. Here is the link to their website so you can book your tickets in advance. www.argosycruises.com If this is your first time in Seattle, you are going to fall in love with this city! Enjoy it and have a safe trip.",5
941,941,"Excellent - this will be our first choice next time! The hotel itself and our room was stylish and elegant. We paid extra for a deluxe room which was extremely comfortable, quite large and had a view of the Space Needle.Reception staff and the valet were friendly and professional.The loaction is excellent. We only had one day there to explore but managed to fit in Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square, some shopping in Macy's and because it's right next door to the monorail, we managed to squeeze in a trip up to the Seattle Centre with a vist to the Space Needle.This would be our first choice when visiting Seattle again.",5
942,942,"Perfect Hotel This is a perfect hotel in a wonderful spot. Not only were the staff friendly and knowledgeable, but the room was terrific. It was very comfortable and had all the amenities. I will stay here anytime I am in Seattle and recommend it to all. Be sure and call the hotel and ask about specials. If you don't ask, they won't tell.",5
943,943,"Beautiful Little Hotel Stayed four nights at Mayflower Park as part of a girls weekend. Can was a quick ride and $38 from airport. We boooked this hotel because it was near everything we were interested in.Check in-I'd called ahead and told the front desk I was a light sleeper and would like a quiet room. I had a nice conversation with the girl and she said no problem, but when I arrived at my room, it was right next to the elevator. I went straight back and explained the problem. First I was told there were no other rooms, so I asked if I could pay extra for an upgraded room and I was told there were none. Finally I was given a quieter room, but with a view of a ugly brick wall. I made my request when I booked four months prior and called to confirm two days ahead so this shouldn't have been an issue.Room-Very small but perfect for just me. I did find myself feeling abit closed in. The bath towels could have been nicer. The bed was fine. I slept great every night but better linens are always a plus-maybe Mayflower Park should invest in some. The walls were also very thin. The housekeeping staff was wonderful. Had drinks and Bar snacks downstairs-wonderful and room service breakfast one day-wonderful and quick. I gave this above average because I would stay again and I enjoyed the experience of a smaller hotel and not a big chain. I also was really close to everything I wanted. We walked constantly, Pike's Market, Pioneer Square (Teri Lyn at Bill Speidels Underground tour was the best), Capitol Hill, all the shops and restaurants in the CBD, ferries, etc. I think this hotel is great for single travelers that enjoy something a little more elegant but keep in mind it is an old people with very thin walls.",4
944,944,"A very nice stay Mayflower Park Hotel is a great choice if you want something equidistant between the Space Needle and the basball/football arenas, as I did. The needle is definitely walkable.The stadiums are too, but are much longer.Definitely leave 30-40 minutes for that walk.Another thing that's very close is Pike Place Market. It's only a few blocks away.Also, you're right next to all major shopping, tins of restaurants, Starbucks of course, and plenty of fast-food joints.The staff was extremely friendly and I would easily stay there again. The rooms are pleasant. I had a classic room, and it was a touch small, but it's fine fine for one or two people.",4
945,945,"Elegant hotel, friendly staff and close to everything We stayed at the Mayflower Park hotel before departing on an Alaskan cruise and couldn't have been more pleased. We felt absolutely spoiled here--we had a lovely and spacious corner room with a view of the space needle (didn't even request it--lucky us!). This historic hotel's renovations were incredible. The bed linens were top quality, carpets were imaculate, wet bar area was a wonderful surprise and there must have been 4 sets of windows in the room at least. The marble bath was fantastic, as were the toiletries and the lighting. The staff was very helpful from the moment we stepped on the sidewalk until they loaded our bags in the cab the next day. Our only regret was that we didn't stay longer. We discovered in our room directory, a welcome pass to Macys with a percent off coupon, for being visitors to Seattle. We arrived from a very long flight and were exhausted but with limited time in Seattle we forced ourselves to get out of our comfy room to see the sights of Seattle. We were maybe 4 blocks from Pike Place Market, just around the corner from a mall, several restaurants, across the street from Macy's and maybe 6-10 blocks from the Space Needle. There is only one or two small elevators, but in a historic hotel, I had no problem--we maybe waited 2-3 minutes for a ride. We must have passed 3 Starbucks just on the short walk to Gordon Biersch brew pub (wonderful views of Seattle, great food and muted lighting were perfect after a long day of travel). We slept like rocks on our comfier-than-home bed and awoke very early the next morning (still being on eastern time) and luckily that worked in our favor. We grabbed a cuppa joe at (of course) Starbucks and walked down to Pike Place and watched the flower markets and food markets open and get ready for the day. We walked behind the marketplace to see the sound in the morning and then tucked back in to Pike to one of the best diners, The Atheneum. We ate a hearty breakfast for about $6 each with coffee/juice. The inside felt like a classic seaside diner with a counter and several (full) booths. Great views of the sound from the windows and very friendly staff. Just let us take our time to relax and enjoy the view and food--no rushing. We walked through a few shops and headed back to the room a few hours later to check out. As we were checking out the doorman arranged a cab, and hauled our bags for us. Cannot say enough nice things about Seattle or this hotel. A great city, clean, friendly laid back people and great weather. One thing we didn't take advantage of was the hotel restaurant or room service. The food smelled fantastic though.",5
946,946,"Great Location and Reasonable Rates We stayed at the Mayflower Park for two nights over the Easter Long Weekend. We loved the location (right in the middle of shopping, restaurants and very close to Pike Place Market) and were impressed with the friendly car valet and very courteous and helpful front desk staff.Rooms and bathrooms were not large but fit our needs just fine. I had looked at other nearby hotels and found the rates at the Mayflower to be very reasonable for the area. We had a great time walking around Seattle and enjoyed eating at nearby restaurants expecially at Etta's Seafood  Assiago's. We also liked Bill Sepidel's Underground Tour in Pioneer Square. When we checked out, we were asked if we wanted to leave our bags for a while. There was no fee for this and I thought that this was very thoughtful. It was nice to leave our car in the valet parking and our bags in the hotel while we took the underground tour and did some shopping before heading home.",4
947,947,"Historic downtown hotel with a good location Wanting to take our 2 teenage kids to see another city, Seattle was next on our list. I decided to book 2 deluxe rooms at the Mayflower Park hotel based on its location and positive reviews here on Tripadvisor. We prefer to stay at hotels that have a local feel, rather than a corporate hotel. This hotel fit that bill. Our rooms were nicely furnished. My husband and I had a corner room (I specifically requested because the deluxe ones are slightly larger). On the 10th floor we had a fun view of the Macy's marquee out one window and the Seattle Space Needle out the other. Our kids shared a double queen that had 2 seperate bathrooms! and an amazing picture view ot the Needle.Having 2 bathrooms for the kids was a very pleasant surprise, because the bathrooms are not large. One of my few complaints about this hotel is the lack of vanity space and the very low water pressure (at least on the 10th floor.) I am not sure exactly how many rooms have this double bathroom feature, but I would ask about it if I were booking here again.The hoitel is located right next to the Monorail to visit EMP and the Space Needle. We all enjoyed EMP. Views from the top of the Needle were gorgeous and we were able to see all the way to Canada and all of the surrounding snow covered mountains.The Mayflower Park is very well located to ALL of the major shopping and just a few blocks from Pikes Place Market and lots of great places to have dinner. We really enjoyed Etta's Seafood.It had a great Seattle vibe, and something for everyone.Our best breakfast was sharing a bag of just fried dounut holes from a vendor at Pikes Place Market and coffee.As I said before, I had few complaints. I do see room for improvement in two areas: better beds (they move ALOT when ever your partner moves) and larger bath towels would be nice. My husband and I had cocktails down at Oliver's in the lobby. Nice bar. We did have a forgettable breakfast at the hotel and did not return to eat any other meals there. Having access to free wireless in our room was nice, too.All considered it is a good, centrally located historic hotel.",3
948,948,"Charming classic hotel in good location We spent four nights at the Mayflower in February 2007. We understand that the hotel was close to being torn down when it was rescued and completely renovated by a local group. It is now an independently-owned hotel in the style of upscale classic city hotels, entirely non-smoking and in the heart of downtown Seattle within several blocks of Pike鈥檚 Market. For those who shop, it is convenient to major chain stores (Macy鈥檚, Nordstrom etc), and opens directly from the lobby into Westlake Center (an indoor multi-story shopping mall). Room costs vary and one can find bargain rates via the internet as we did.Our room had two queen beds, a large desk with drawers for clothing, an armoire with TV above and more drawers below, a coffee maker (with regular and decaf coffee and tea provided). There was no mini-fridge 鈥?though we did not ask to see if one might be provided on request. The bathroom had a tub/shower and single sink, with 3 sets of thick towels (for two people). The d茅cor was tasteful and attractive 鈥?dark wood Chippendale-style furniture in excellent condition, tasteful carpeting and drapes. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. I communicated with one concierge by email and phone and she responded quickly and fully to my questions about transportation from the airport. The concierge on duty during our stay responded to our queries with enthusiasm 鈥?calling a place we asked about visiting to make sure they would be open, making dinner reservations on our behalf, recommending another excellent restaurant and suggesting a theatre performance that we thoroughly enjoyed.Transportation from the airport is available by taxi, shuttle, and Grayline hotel bus. The latter is by far the least expensive for one person traveling alone (less than half of the shuttle cost, and about a third of the taxi fare) but stops at the Westin Hotel which is a short 1.5 blocks from the Mayflower Park. The short walk is slightly uphill and is very easy with a small roll-on suitcase. The hotel has its own parking garage on site.The hotel has an attractive bar and a restaurant, but no souvenir or other shop. For toiletries and the like, there is a drugstore a half block away from the Mayflower Park. For other items, there is the small but well-stocked gourmet Ralph鈥檚 Grocery  Deli about two blocks away from the hotel on 4th Avenue. Ralph鈥檚 has a good selection of local Washington state and other wines, cold beer, and makes sandwiches to order as well as selling other grocery items. The owner (Joe Cohen) is very knowledgeable and most helpful with choices of Washington state wine and port as well as other products in his store.",5
949,949,"Location, Location, Location!! This hotel is like being in Mecca if you're idea of Nirvana is shopping. It is very easy to locate in Seattle. The car valets were helpful and courteous. The front desk staff were prompt. And the concierge, well, he was the absolute best we have ever had. He had suggestions for shows, attractions, timelines, and restaurants. He even made suggestions for what to order off the menus!The room we had was a standard with a small queen. It was a corner room with 2 windows that opened to let in fresh air (yes, you need fresh air even in frigid February). It was a little stuffy without the windows being left open. I would say spend a little extra money and get a deluxe room with a king. The bathroom was also very small and not big enough for 2 people sharing! Definitely need either 2 bathrooms (as some of the more deluxe rooms have), or ask for one with a larger bathroom.However, we didn't spend hardly any time in the hotel as we were out and about so much.The location was ideal. One block from either direction of both Macy's and Nordstrom's (and about 6 Starbuck's coffee bars in a 4 block radius). Plus, just 5 minute walks from other name-brand chains. And close to Pike Place market and great venues like the Triple Door, and fantastic restaurants. Too many restaurants to choose from. All that means is that we will need to go back and try them all out. And we will definitely be staying at the Mayflower Park Hotel; plan to make it 'our hotel' whenever we go to Seattle.",5

951,951,"A Gem in the Emerald City As a special treat for my wifes birthday, I booked an overnight at the Mayflower Park. I had not seen anything about this hotel prior to visiting the 5th Ave Theatres website, which directed me to this hotel as part of their family of hotels in the area. I had already made reservations at the Fairmont Olympic, but decided to try the Mayflower Park. ( I was taken by the price difference of about 250 dollars/night)From the moment we booked the room, to the time we left, we found the Mayflower Park to be an exceptional boutique hotel. I was first impressed by the lobby decor and lighting, and a front desk staff that was polite, welcoming and very efficient. we had a corner room which was smaller than an average room, but very very clean and delightful. It reminded us of some very good hotels we stayed in Paris, but half the cost.Dinner at Andalucas was remarkable. The ambiance, impeccable service, friendliness and price were all well within the range of excellent. I had the quail, which I must add, was fantastic.After seeing White Christmas at the 5th Ave Theatre (beautiful show and theatre) we walked back to the Mayflower Park to be once again welcomed by the front desk staff who inquired about our evening at the show. The fact they take an interest in what we do while staying in the neighborhood makes me feel like a valued customer. Bed was very comfortable. bathroom, clean as any can be. Overall room appeal was great, and with a corner room you may find a bit more street noise, but I still say it is worth it.I can highly recomend this hotel for anyone. I do not however recomend it if you have children, as some guests, and the closeness of the rooms might make your children feel out of place and unwanted. Happy Travels!",5
952,952,"As a local, I have a totally different perception I have been reading all the reviews of the hotels that have been ranked above the Mayflower, and I find it very interesting. I live within 10 miles of the Mayflower, but every year our dinner club books a night here during the Christmas holidays so that we can eat downtown, experience the city, and not have to drive after we have had many cocktails. This year was no exception. The hotels that were mentioned with a higher rating than the Mayflower are great hotels. However, the Mayflower is far and above the others. This hotel has a much better central location, the rooms are large and very well appointed, the staff is great and courteous AND for the location and room - the price can't be beat. The hotels in the University District and on Lake Union are great - BUT they are a cab ride away from downtown Seattle. The Mayflower is right in the middle of Seattle - within walking distance of the waterfront, Pike Place Market, Nordstrom, Macy's - all the best restaurants. Plus, it is so reasonable. If this is where the locals choose to stay - we can't be that wrong. We love this hotel. The staff is wonderful and the Anduluca Restaurant is superb. Oliver's Martini Bar gets crowded - so arrive early! You will truly experience what Seattle is at this hotel.",5

954,954,"A European Styled Hotel in Downtown Seattle If you want a hotel with a big Lobby packed with guests lounging around waiting for their Convention buddies so they can go to a noisy hotel bar, then the Mayflower is not the place you will want to stay.The Mayflower is one of those small historic hotels that if you were in London you would be writing home about. Cozy, charming and right downtown near all the stores including Nordstroms across the street. Yes, the bathrooms are on the small side but done in a very nice black  white tile. Oliver's is the bar in the hotel and they are know for their martinis and the hotel breakfast at Andaluca is very good.If you are bringing your car, let me suggest you valet park it and then walk around downtown or take a cab, as it less expensive to do that than pay $12 for a 2-hour parking lot near Pike Place Market or a similar amount down near the waterfront. By the way, you won't be fighting a tour bus when you arrive, as it is a hotel made for people not conventioneers running up and down the hallway at 2am.Not cheap...but I have found not much is among the better hotels in Seattle these days.",4

956,956,"Noise issues for some rooms Very nice hotel, room was a bit small but nicely appointed. Staff was VERY friendly and helpful. One problem which I considered unacceptable was our room was located on the 6th floor, backside of the building, which was right across the alley from the HVAC system of the building next door. It was very loud and made for a terrible night's sleep. The hotel was fully booked, so no relief was available.If you choose this hotel, make sure you request a room facing 4th or Olive Sts. The traffic noise is to be expected in a downtown hotel, but not the alternative.Other than that, great place.",2
957,957,"Enjoyed Mayflower Park Rooms were comfortable and pretty, with an old-fashioned ambience. In-house restaurant (Andaluca) was excellent. We liked the free wireless internet. Location was good: close enough to the waterfront, without being so close that crowds and noise were a problem.",5
958,958,"Underwhelming but not a bad choice My husband and I stayed 3 nights at the Mayflower Park in July 2006. I chose it for the very central location -- walking distance to the Pikes Market, Space Needle, ferry terminal, monorail, etc.; the price-point -- about $215/night plus tax; and the good reviews here and elsewhere. The biggest problem was that our room's air conditioning was not working. It was close to 80 degrees in the room. An engineer came up twice, but the problem was never fixed. Ultimately, the engineer admitted to us our room had a problem as did another room on our floor. We had to ask to be moved to another room -- no offer was made. The substitute room looked out at a brick wall. It appeared to be a single -- full bed, not queen; one nightstand; no table by the reading chair as in our first room. The room rate was adjusted down, but it was a lesser room, so it just ended up feeling like the hotel didn't care more than the minimum necessary. On Sunday, our room was not made up until 4:30 in the afternoon, after we had been out all day and returned hoping to relax for a while. When our bill was prepared, we were incorrectly double-charged. The hotel provides one computer for free internet access, but it is not easily found and no one told us about it. Not awful problems, just annoying. The Mayflower is a place with lots of brass trim, big flower arrangements in the lobby, and you have to call room service if you want ice. If that's your style, and if the air conditioning in your room is working, I think you'll find the Mayflower to be a fair choice. If you're like me, and favor modern accommodations, no opulent frllls, consistent quality, and a feeling you are a valued customer. . . you may end up deciding the Mayflower Park is a bit underwhelming.",2

We were on the 6th floor on the corner of 4th  Olive and had no problem with the noise from the roads. The staff were very friendly and very helpful. A lovely place to stay and would recommend it.",5
961,961,"Great Location! My husband and I spent a week in the hotel and loved the location.

The service was fantastic and would definitely stay at the Mayflower again!",4
962,962,"Classy and friendly hotel Seattle is a friendly city anyway but the Mayflower Park made it even more so. The staff were always ready with a friendly word, even if they didn't have to bother - and it really made our trip. We had a superb room, quite high up with a view (of the Space Needle) as requested. The room was beautifully clean and very well maintained, comfortable and relaxing. Situated Downtown, the hotel is in an excellent position for all the main attractions and an oasis away from the hustle and bustle of shopping and business. Expensive yes, but a great start to our two weeks holiday. A very classy and stylish hotel.",5
963,963,"Good Location, too much $$$ for room My husband and I just got back from spending one evening at the Mayflower. It is a very beautifully decorated hotel. We arrived early and they held our bags for us and called us when our room was ready. When we went in the room our first reaction was good....we got the deluxe room/with parking, which is a queen sized bed (although it looked like a double) and a little sitting area. The down sides started at about 10:00 at night since our room was located right by a stockroom so basically until 12:00am/1:00am there was a very loud noise outside our bedroom of whatever or whomever was working out in the hallway. As well, we were on the 8th floor and we could still hear all the noises out on the street?? Insulation not so great? You could also hear doors slamming and water running.Upon investigating a bit found bathroom was very small....my husband at 6'1 had to crouch down to take a shower since the showerhead was quite low. The check in/out agents were not the friendliest, but were friendly enough. I think that with the amount of $$$ this hotel charges it is more for the location than the service or quality of room.The reasoning for my review is that we actually stayed at the Holiday Inn in Downtown Everett the night before at 1/3 of the price (it is only 1/2 hour from downtown Seattle) and the service was 100% better, as well as our room was bigger (king size bed) and the bathroom was double the size. So if you want to stay specifically in downtown Seattle then I agree the Mayflower is definitely a good location, but if you don't mind staying out a bit, try the Holiday Inn Downtown Everett!! Well worth it!",3
964,964,Great first trip to Seattle I am a little late posting had a great experience and had to share. I had my first business trip to Seattle and stayed at the Mayflower. What a great hotel! Arrived a little early and room was not ready but they held my luggage and recommended a great burger joint down the road. Once I got in my room I was so happy I picked this hotel. The room was so cute! A little small but nice. The bathroom had Aveda products which I thought was a nice touch. I highly recommend this hotel!,4
965,965,"Even the pilgrims would be proud of this Mayflower I treated my wife to a night at the Mayflower Park for her birthday. They offer a great theater package that includes two tickets to the Fifth Avenue Theater (about three blocks away), valet parking and a room for the night. They also offer shopper and romance packages. First, you can't beat the Mayflower Park's location: it's in the center of downtown Seattle, adjacent to Westlake Mall shopping center and all of major department stores. The Mayflower Park is a great, 1927 vintage hotel that has been renovated without losing its deco character. The staff are attentive and friendly. We received a call within 5 minutes of going to our room to see if everything was okay.Our room was tiny by modern standards, but it was decorated so well that you almost didn't notice. Since the room was small, so was the bed. But it was comfortable. We also had a great view of the city and the holiday lights. The bathroom retains much of the original tile and has been renovated with high quality fixtures. All rooms include robes, irons, and coffee makers. The rooms seem well insulated as we didn't hear any noise from the hall or the street.The hotel has a great martini bar Olivers, and an upscale restaurant, Andaluca. We had a wonderful, romantic dinner before going to the theater. The food was top notch as was the service and ambiance.The only downside to the Mayflower Park was the lack of on site workout facilities and the elevators. There are only two elevators and they are small and extremely slow. But other than that, I highly recommend the Mayflower Park for a weekend getaway or a base camp for exploring Seattle.",4
966,966,"Fantastic Friday at the Mayflower Park Stayed here on the recommendation of many co-workers, many native Seattle-ites. It was just lovely. It's always a treat to stay in a hotel that is part of the Historic Hotels of America and this one was a gem. Great front-desk staff who really made an effort to take their time with each person. The room, though smaller than modern hotel rooms, was tasteful and comfortable, and best of all--quiet! Our corner room gave us a view of the Space Needle and Queen Anne. And the bathroom was terrific--especially that old-fashioned bathtub that was deep enough for a good soak on a cold, wet evening. Oliver's, just off the lobby, makes an exquisite martini, too.",5
967,967,above average Mayflower Hotel was very nice and very convienient to points of interest and shopping. Room was clean and well maintained. Staff was professional and helpful. Found both Anduluca Restaurant and lounge excellent. They both mix superb drinks and food is out of this world; both worth a visit. My only complaint was that elevators are slow.,4
968,968,"A touch of luxury A really nice hotel in all respects: decent size, well appointed room; comfortable bathrooms; a great cocktail bar; and tasty food in the restaurant. We would thoroughly recommend it as a safe bet in a good location.",5
969,969,"nice hotel, small problems which were addressed We stayed at the Mayflower park for 2 nights in October 2005 as return visitors. As others have said, the staff is really the best! Derek the Concierge is extremely helpful. He made arrangements for a shuttle service to pick us up and take us to QWest Field (only $5.00 per person round trip) for the football game which was the main purpose for our visit to Seattle this time and gave us the names of plenty of restaurants from which to choose. Robert at the front desk couldn't have been nicer. We had some noise issues due to the location of our room (the headboards of our beds shared a common wall with the housekeeping supply room) so there was no sleeping past 8:00am, the time housekeeping starts working. When we spoke to Robert about this and a couple other small problems (the spigot of the bathtub fell out of the wall on my husband's foot and the air conditioning wasn't working too well), he immediately offered to refund half of the cost of our first night's stay. Not what we were looking for but very, very much appreciated! Also as others have said, the bathroom in our room was extremely small but they do the best with the space they have. The location of the hotel is very convenient to many of the great sights, shopping and restaurants of downtown Seattle. We'll be back.",4

971,971,"good hotel, thin walls I liked the room, although it is small. The staff were great.oor.Furnishings were nice and the bed was comfy.My only compalint is what I could hear next door. Their TV woke me up too early, they weren't talking loud, but I could hear them form time to time. If I wanted a romantic get away, I would go somewhere else with more privacy.",4

973,973,"Nice hotel, good location, friendly service We spent a night at the Mayflower Park in August. The service was great and everyone was very attentive and very accommodating. We requested a room upgrade, but the hotel was full. However, the front desk clerk gave us coupons for free drinks and appetizers in the lounge. The lounge was great and so were the free drinks and appetizers. The room was really small and the bathroom was tiny, but this is an older hotel. We didn't have time to use the fitness center, but it looked really good for this range hotel - lots of newer equipment, tvs and magazines to make it less tedious, and the air conditioning worked. We'd definitely consider staying at this hotel again.",4
974,974,"Mayflower Park Hotel-Great Location, Great Hotel We enjoyed a two night stay at the Mayflower Park Hotel in August, 2005. While it was a busy time in Seattle (The Ring Cycle was at the opera that week) we were upgraded to a suite which was a pleasant surprise. We had a wet bar with coffeemaker, mini-refigerator and sink, large living area with desk (free wireless internet access too, very nice), sofa and comfy chairs, king bed, large closet/dressing room, and nice bathroom though small, but with historic fittings. The Hotel is a member of the Historic Hotels of America, and the lobby is small but evokes a historic feeling. Another nice bonus was the invitation to the Wednesday early evening wine tasting and hors d'oeuvres in the restaurant, Andalucia. Very pleasant experience. We didn't have time to use the fitness center, but the hotel's location right in the center of town provided us lots of exercise walking up and down Seattle's hills. We walked to REI, the Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square and even the Victory Brewery from the hotel. The front desk and bell staff were particularly helpful, and the host at the wine tasting was very pleasant. We would certainly recommend the Mayflower Park Hotel and will definitely stay there again-there was so much to see and do in Seattle, we barely scratched the surface!",5
975,975,"great location, great hotel What a great hotel! Stayed here for 3 days before boarding a cruise to Alaska. The location is fantastic. We saw all of Seattle's best sites and never needed a car. The monorail station is in the adjoining mall. Could walk to Pike Place, flagship Nordstrom (yay), even to Safeco Field to see the Mariners. The staff was gracious and helpful, always willing to offer directions, suggestions or to secure a cab when needed. The rooms weren't huge, but more than adequate - light and very clean. Would definitly come back.",5
976,976,"What a fabulous hotel experience!! This is my second visit to this hotel.It was as lovely as I remembered it. The amenties, decor and ambiance that this hotel portrays makes you feel luxurious! The history of the hotel alone, makes you feel as if you have stepped back into the early days of Seattle. The entire staff was very helpful, pleasant and warm. It is so nice to come to a hotel and feel like you are truly being taken care of. I think the location is perfect; close to downtown shopping, people watching, and a short hike to Pike's Place Market. I recommend this hotel to anyone I know who is going to the Seattle area. I travel throughout the US with my job so staying in hotels is a given. This was a treat! I commend everyone at the Mayflower and I look forward to my next visit there!",5
977,977,"Enjoyed the Mayflower Park Great location, historic hotel with very good staff. Unfortunately the air conditioning was broken the evening I stayed at the hotel. I was immediately given a fan which worked very well and I was very comfortable. I was very satisfied with my stay and loved the location in the middle of shopping. Would definately stay at the Mayflower again.",4
978,978,"Loved the Mayflower! We stayed at the Mayflower Park for two nights and thoroughly enjoyed it. The room (deluxe) was large and beautiful with a couch and two upholstered chairs, desk and nice furnishings. The bathroom was small but not too small. Nice linens and towels. We didn't have a car and thought the location was ideal for shopping, Pike's market, Seattle Center and even walked all the way back from the baseball game through Pioneer Square, etc (about 30 minutes). The staff were all very friendly and helpful and Andaluca's, the restaurant, was excellent (had breakfast and dinner). We would definitely stay here again!",5
979,979,"Very Satisfied We stayed two nights in a deluxe room (7th floor at the corner of Olive and 4th). The rate was competitive with other downtown hotels that were highly rated on this site, and I was unable to find a better rate on Hotwire for a hotel of the same class. The room was large with an excellent bed and a comfortable sitting area, adequate closet and drawer space, nicely decorated and appointed. The bathroom was small (no vanity) and I had some difficulty maintaining constant water temperature in the shower. There was some noise from the hallway but muffled, not loud enough to disturb the peace except doors slamming in the morning. The staff was uniformly friendly and helpful (parking valets who offered to take care of luggage if we wanted, front desk staff, and especially concierge). The location is excellent, especially close to shopping, a few blocks walk to Pike Place Market and the waterfront, about a 15-20 minute walk to Pioneer Square. Were I to return to Seattle, I would return to the Mayflower Park unless an equivalent hotel offered a substantially better price.",4
980,980,"The Mayflower Park Hotel is Outstanding! Subject: Mayfair Park HotelLocation: SeattleTitle: Mayfair Park Hotel is OutstandingID#: 3547496 The Mayfair Park Hotel completely surpassed our expectations. When we made our reservations we explained that we had never visited Seattle, that my husband is in ill health with mobility restrictions. We requested a Deluxe room, with a sitting area, which at that time was not available. Imagine our pleasant surprise when we arrived on June 1 to find we had been upgraded to a beautiful corner suite with separate bedroom. The hotel is elegant with the best trained, pleasant staff we've ever encountered. The hotel is perfectly situated right next to the Westlake Mall and the monorail to the Space Needle. We had planned to stay 3 days but my husband's health problems made it necessary to cancel the last night. The hotel was gracious and understanding, allowing us late check out. We would recommend the Mayfair Park Hotel to anyone looking for a truly magnificent experience in Seattle. A TripAdvisor MemberFt. Myers, FL",5
981,981,"Great downtown location Fantastic location - right in the centre of the shopping part of downtown, with acess directly into the Westlake shopping centre and great transport links.Room was not huge but adequately sized and clean. Doors on hotel rooms were on sprung hinges and tended to slam a bit, and walls were on the thin side, but these were minor issues. Staff were helpful and friendly - restaurant was pricey but the food did smell pretty good.Good food nearby at Changs (in Westlake) and microbrew pubs in both Rainier Square and Pacific Place. Would gladly stay here again.",4
982,982,"Quaint and Convenient Mayflower Park I have been living in this cute, little hotel once a month for about 3 years now (3-12 day stays over the last three years), so this might be somewhat biased. I reside here for business reasons, so the free WiFi is much appreciated. The rooms are small as American hotels go, so if you like larger rooms, go elsewhere. Even the suites (I've stayed in almost all the rooms at this point) are small. However, the warmth of the staff over the years (with little turn-over, actually) and the coziness of both the connected bar, Oliver's (one of the best Martini bars in Seattle- a MUST!!! even if you don't stay here) and Andaluca restaurant, which is pricey but tastey (free wine tastings on Wednesdays) are sometimes worth the small rooms. The hotel is conveniently located near several restaurants and many stores: Macy's (they give you discounts for this former Bon Marche at the hotel), Nordstroms, Abercrombie, Sophora, etc. The hotel is connected to Westlake Mall (another convenience), and the monorail is on the top floor that can take you to the Space Needle, park, and Experience Music. The Simpson's did a take-off on this one minute monorail, another part of Seattle life. Each room is carpeted with an armoir that contains a t.v. and drawers for whatever, no mini-bar. The beds are quite comfortable, and a.c. or heat are generally in good working order. If you're uncomfortable, go down to the desk and let them know- they will re-accomodate you. The restrooms are nice, but have limited space just above the sink on a glass railing to place personal items. Aveda products (shampoo, conditioner, soap, and body lotion) are provided as complimentary items. Showers are somewhat narrow, so it help to put the rubber mat on the floor. All closets are a very nice size with thin, cloth robes provided. Of course, very Seattle-esque, there is a Tully's on one corner and Starbucks just behind the hotel. I have read many of the reviews thus far, and I agree with all of them; however, one must remember that Seattle is the Emerald City, and people operate on a completely different level than in other parts of the country; it's part of the charm (and sometimes healthy tension). Having lived in New York, L.A., Dallas, and Houston, it was culture shock at first, but then it became delightlful and the source of good laughter. I got a good laugh from the review before mine about the guy not knowing how to make coffee- that's so Seattle. Yes, phone servce in the hotel is not the best, but Seattle people like face to face, and the responsibilities of that SMALL front desk with that many rooms and people wearing two hats is difficult.... Just relax. The lobby is GORGEOUS! A huge chandelier hanging in the front with fresh slowers put in often. The 2nd lobby floor (that connects to Westlake) contains a player piano and great sitting area fo meetings. Meeting rooms are great at his hotel, which is often the host to social events, from weddings to other celebrations.My only complaint is about the elevators: they are certainly large enough, but since the wait staff, maids, etc. use them, they often take a LONG LONG time to get to the lobby. Just go the bar, get a Martini, then catch it when you can. Make sure to visit restaurants along the Sound. The concierge (Derrick these days) is excellent, and they can get you deals that sometimes you can't- every conciege at this hotel has been both brilliant and enthusiastically helpful.",4
983,983,"Terrible service I flew to Seattle from Reno to see Audioslave perform and stayed at The Mayflower Park Hotel for 5 nights.My first problem was with room service. They almost never pick up the phone and I always ended up calling the front desk to place my orders. I tried ordering coffee once, at 3 pm Friday and was told I have to wait until 4pm because the person there didn't know how to make coffee. That was a pretty strong statement, so I decided to go to the bar and have a drink and see how service is in there. Big mistake! Not only were the employees rude, but the Bloody Mary I ordered was filled to the rim with ice, which I hate. I asked for a glass to get rid of some of the ice and the bartender actually got mad at me!The alltime worst incident came when I gave a maid $20 to clean my room, which I think is a lot of money for 10 minutes work and she told management I smoked in a non-smoking room, which resulted in a $120 fine, because she'd seen my cigarettes on the table.Fortunately Audioslave was incredible and my trip was far from ruined but The Mayflower Park Hotel just isn't a good value.",2
984,984,Wonderful Experience Stayed at the Mayflower Park in Feb 2005 for a few days and had a wonderful experience. We were able to obtain the Entertainment rate which was 50% off the rack rate. Room was very large and we had a view of the Space Needle. Front desk staff was very helpful with last minute dinner recommendations. Did not eat at the hotel because it was on the expensive side and there were so many places to eat within walking distance. Monorail entrance is located next to the hotel and the underground bus stop is down the block. Definitely would stay at this hotel again.,5
985,985,"Can't Beat the Location, But Not Posh Yes, a great location for shopping-one can keep an eye on the stores from one's window! Easy walking to entertainment, Pike Market, restaurants. Helpful staff. Nice bedding.But, no doorman, no bell boy, two small elevators that fill quickly, and turndown service at an earlybird hour of 6pm.Because we were using gift certificates, the hotel would only give us a room at full rack rate ($125 more than what we could've gotten at the hotel's own website)-definitely not worth full rack rate.",3
986,986,"Nice place, great location Very roomy and quiet rooms. Nice service and extras. Close to everything... shopping, food, sight-seeing, the fish market is great. Beware non-smokers: the bar can get smoky at certain times, as well as most restaurants in the city. Call before showing up. This place is recommended.",4
987,987,"Great Central Location This hotel is ideally located 4 blocks from Pike's Market and right at the beginning of the monorail line leading to the Space Needle. Also, there is a direct covered access to the mall surrounding the monorail station. The bar of the hotel offers a great view of the street of Seattle, and fine cocktails. The room was on the small side and did not have a safe even though it is offered at the reception for free.The complimentary wireless internet access was a great help to do some research while in town.A note: We do not know why but there was always a distinct scent of pizza in the hallways and the lobby area....... maybe from the adjoining mall and food court???????",4
988,988,"Boutique hotel for well to do Good points: attractive historic lobby, late check out, very helpful bellmen, location in heart of downtown shopping area (five blocks from Pike's Place Market).Bad points: very expensive for what we got (with additional services such as bottled water in room charged for). Small room with thin walls. Charge for internet access not made clear until you had signed up.",3
989,989,"Great historic hotel! I love the Mayflower Park! My room was extraordinarily comfortable. Great furnishings, good layout and everything worked! (This is not typical in many hotels these days).I love the location, too. Very convenient to all Seattle has to offer.",5
990,990,"Trust me, it's great! We just returned from our first trip to Seattle. We booked Mayflower Park hotel based on comments on this site so we thought we'd share our own experience to add to the mix. we were so happy we stayed here. Every detail, every request (early check-in, rollaway, family package tickets) was ready and waiting when we arrived. our room was fantastic and our children are still talking about the great hotel with TWO bathrooms in our one deluxe room. The location was great. Stores, shopping, and sites are all nearby or easy to access by monorail /shuttle. The staff was helpful and friendly (the concierge a little less so.) We had drinks at the bar which was nice but pricey. We had dinner at Andaluca's which was fine but nothing spectacular and somewhat slow service even when it wasn't busy. Overall, our stay was great and we hope to return one day!",5
991,991,"Great location...great hotel! What a wonderful find! We found this hotel on the internet and it sounded nice, but didn't know if we might find some shortcomings that weren't divulged on their web site once we arrived. We were pleasantly surprised, as the place was just as nice (even nicer) than we expected. A very attentive staff, a classic old-hotel feel, yet equipped with most of the amenities you find in newer facilities. The location was perfect -- we couldn't have been more centrally located. Just about 4 blocks from the Pike's market, right in the heart of the downtown shopping and dining district, around the corner from the monorail stop to the Seattle Center (it was down while we were there, but they have a shuttle bus operating in the meantime). There's even direct access from the hotel to the underground bus line that's free within the downtown area. The beds were comfortable, the concierge very helpful...just a wonderful place to stay -- with the delightful character from an era that existed before the big hotel chains arrived on the scene. The only negative was the bar/lounge that's adjacent to the elevators. The drinks they served were marvelous, but unlike the rest of the hotel, they do allow smoking in the bar. So the smoke odor tends to drift into the hotel lobby/elevator area, which was unfortunate (especially since, being from California, we're used to hotels, bars  restaurants which are completely smoke-free). It would have been nice if they could have separated the bar from the rest of the hotel with doors, so the smoke stayed in the bar and didn't drift into the hotel area. Other than that, no complaints!",5
992,992,"wonderful stay ALthough the decorating of the room was a little drab and dark, overall the facility was very nice. We had a deluxe single which was a spacious corner room with a large seating area. THe staff was gracious and helpful and the price reasonable for Seattle in Season. Location is also wonderful as you can walk to almost everthing and or take convenient bus service.",4
993,993,"Always Satisfied I have stayed at this hotel many, many times and I have always been happy. The fact that it is attached to a mall is great as I often travel alone and it is nice to be able to pop over to the mall without having to walk any where alone. The rooms are always very clean and comfortable.",4
994,994,"Wonderful hotel! We just spent three nights at the Mayflower Park and we had a wonderful experience. It is a neat old hotel with a lot of charm. The staff is friendly, and the concierge folks are very helpful. There is hardly any noise from the other rooms. Good beds; not rock-hard like some hotels. Oliver's, the bar, is a bit pricey, but so convenient (though it would be better if it was nonsmoking like the rest of the hotel). We had an upper floor room with a great view of the Space Needle. The location can't be beat, either. We walked everywhere. The concierge helped us rent a car for one day and we explored the Olympic Peninsula. My husband would have preferred staying somewhere cheaper, but he couldn't deny that we had a nice experience at the Mayflower Park.",5
995,995,"Happy, happy Traveling with an 18 year old granddaughter, we were concerned two nights in a botique hotel might be too much. She loved the mall being connected to the hotel, she adored the play the hotel got tickets for (Millie), she thought it wonderful Norstroms was across the street and her favorite store, Ann Taylor's Loft was nearby. Everyone was very friendly (even cab drivers) in the city but the hotel staff and restaurant staff were superior. I can't think of a single bad thing to say. I really want to return soon.",4
996,996,"Great Boutique Hotel!!!! Great hotel with excellent staff!! Friendly and efficient front desk. Called to confirm reservation and Reservations Clerk was extremely nice. Hotel matched rate found on internet. Room was beautifully decorated with Boutique feel. Andaluca (sp?) was Yummy! Full Breakfast for our kids under 10 was free, Olivers' Lounge had the BEST martinis. Could not have asked for better location... we walked to pretty much EVERY attraction. DEFINITELY would stay again. Can't say enough!",5
997,997,"Basic Room With No Special Employee Attitude A very good downtown Seattle location with snobbish attitude at the desk, friendly luggage handlers, outdated interior in need of modernization. Rooms are fairly basic, a bit awkward and small but nonetheless clean. Noisy ambiance due to proximity of the mono-rail which blurts out a super sounding horn at all hours of the night. A nice mall near the hotel, restaurants, Pike Street market and other places within walking distance. Avoid more seedy areas at night, located near Pike Market. A bit pricey for an independent hotel but I would definately think about staying here again if they improve their customer relations skill.",3
