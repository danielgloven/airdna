The location was incredibly convenient. I was able to visit Downtown, Carson, Hawthorne, and Pasadena all relatively quickly. To anyone who's not very familiar with central L.A., the surrounding neighborhood may be off-putting, but I think, the hedges in the front, locked gate, and security doors should offer a little extra peace of mind. 

The inside of the place was very clean-- immaculate, even. We didn't cook or have much use for the refrigerator besides some snacks from the road, but we had everything we needed in case we wanted to prepare or store any food/drinks. The day we arrived was a tad warm and humid, so I was initially bummed about not having A/C, but once we opened the windows and got the fans going for a while, we were just fine.

I also loved that it doesn't have a TV. I understand that may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I enjoyed focusing on other things like books or simple conversation when we wanted to wind down for the night. We didn't spend a ton of time in the apartment besides sleeping and getting ready for the day, so that part of it was perfect. If I had any questions, Bertrand was super friendly and responsible. Checking in and out were a breeze and completely hassle-free. I'd definitely stay again if it's available next time we're in town.

What I mostly appriciated the most is that as soon as I went to bed the Volume of TV and discussions was immediatly down and I could have a good night sleep. They both gave me rides to grocery stores, cause I had no car. I recommend everybody to rent a car as it simplyfies transportation manyfold.
I recommend you to check out their home as they will assure your stay will be as comfortable as possible.

The mini fridge and microwave are a great added touch! I wasn't able to check in until 9pm and Bertrand accommodated the last minute change.  Also, my departing flight was delayed and Bertrand allowed me to hang out in the common area for an extra hour before heading to the airport which was nice. 

CON: This is majority my fault for not fully expanding ""house rules"" but in short, I kinda felt like I was living in a college dorm all over again. ""No being on the patio after 7p, no cooking after 9p, only wash clothes between 10am-6pm"" seems extreme for adults. I'm not a noisy person by any means but felt like I was walking on eggshells so just be sure to read the ENTIRE listing before you book. 

Also: there's a $10 charge to do laundry if you don't stay 7 days, which I paid for the convenience but just be mindful as that seems excessive for a single load of clothes. 

Overall, you can't beat this place for the price and location (close to LAX). If you want a quiet place to sleep/relax it's perfect. However, if you want the freedom to truly make yourself at home this place may not be the best fit. I was always hyper aware that I was in someone else's space which made it hard to feel at ease.
